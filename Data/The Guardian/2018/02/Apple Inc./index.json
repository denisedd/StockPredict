If we get to that point and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted. </p> <p>In contrast, suppose inflation picks up more assuredly, as many expect. Then, we still could easily raise rates another three or even four times in 2018 if that were necessary. And I would support such a faster pace if the data point convincingly in this direction.</p> </blockquote> <p>Evans said he expected US GDP to grow between 2.5% and 2.75% this year, with growth slowing over the next two years as the boost from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts wears off.</p> <p>As for inflation, he expects it to rise gradually over the next few years:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a hint that this may be in train today. Some inflation indicators over the past couple of months have been positive. I also am hearing a bit more commentary from manufacturers about higher commodity prices. While wage increases have been disappointingly low, the most recent data exhibit a firming trend. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently been hearing from more of my business contacts that firms are raising wages, giving additional bonuses, and boosting benefits. These are all positive signs for wage growth and clear signs of tighter labor markets.</p> <p>In my forecast, I expect inflation to rise gradually to our 2 percent target, perhaps reaching it in late 2019 or in 2020. But despite the indicators I just noted, I have not yet seen many actual increases in consumer prices. So, my forecast of reaching our target is still just a forecast. There is still a role for accommodative monetary policy to bring us back to our 2 percent inflation target.</p> </blockquote> <p>Evans voted against a rate rise in December but is a non-voting member this year, so his comments won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily hold much sway when it comes to the path of interest rates, although his reasoning is interesting.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-07T16:43:14.154Z\">at 4.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a7b256fe4b07556c9fb7646\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-07T16:13:14.869Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The rout in stocks seen in the first two days of the week seems a long way away now, as a classic rebound in sentiment sees the Dow gain over 200 points within the first two hours, while the FTSE 100 continues to claw its way higher.</p> <p>The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash on the sidelines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 theory gets a lot of stick these days, since who in their right mind would still hold cash when the market kept racing higher, but evidently equity investors (or their passive machine counterparts) have managed to scrimmage behind the sofa for some more funds in order to go bargain hunting in stock markets.

                "bodyText":"In another volatile day of trading, US markets ended the day in negative territory after a new rise in bond yields. Yields rose after a disappointing bond auction and reports of a new budget deal which would increase current spending caps. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 19.42 points at 24,893.35. After an earlier rise of 381 points this was its biggest turnaround since August 2015. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 ended down 0.5%. On that note we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close up until tomorrow. After their declines on Tuesday, European markets have taken their cue from the overnight rise on Wall Street and also the opening optimism in the US. The FTSE 100, which saw its biggest losses since the Brexit vote on Tuesday, has recovered more than half of the decline, and there was a similar picture elsewhere. Signs that Germany was putting its political differences aside also helped sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 138.02 points or 1.93% at 7279.42 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 1.6% to 12,590.43 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.82% to 5255.90 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 2.86% better at 22,986.18 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.7% at 9976.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.33% to 849.94 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 132 points or 0.49%, off its best levels after US ten year bond yields rose to a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high of 2.828% in the wake of a disappointing auction. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow (unless something major happens before then). Thanks for reading and all your comments. Meanwhile, Greece is mulling pushing ahead with the sale of a seven-year euro benchmark bond - postponed on account of the sell-off - on Thursday, bankers say. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After years of exile, the debt-stricken county is keen to prove it can tap international markets again. The seven-year issue would be its boldest market foray yet, and was formally announced on Monday with trading expected to take place Tuesday. Instead, Greek finance officials took one look at the market rout and thought better of it. But depending on how the US markets perform, trade could begin Thursday bankers are now saying. Greece hopes to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn with the issue as part of efforts to build up a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19bn cash buffer that would allow the country to cover debt repayments independently when its third international bailout programme officially expires in August. Back with cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin is up 4% to $8,050 despite negative comments from Goldman Sachs. Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at payments specialist Centtrip, said: Bitcoin staged a solid recovery today, having previously fallen 70% from its record highs last December. The cryptocurrency briefly dropped below the $6,000 a coin level before gaining almost 40%, and is now back above $8,000 a coin. The rise comes at a time when Goldman...suggested market participants should be ready for cryptocurrencies to hit zero. According to the bank, the fall in cryptocurrencies, which erased nearly $500 billion worth of market value over the last month, could get a lot worse. Nouriel Roubini, an American economist, suggested that bitcoin was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmuch worse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than Tulipmania. His comments had zero impact on the recent surge in Bitcoin, suggesting that some of the optimism around cryptocurrencies is still there. A break of $9,500 would signal further gains for the coin, but a longer term move lower is more likely. US interest rates should not rise before the middle of the year, according to Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans. With the recent strong data - notably Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth - analysts have been becoming more convinced a rate rise is on the cards in March, with four rather than three rises in the rest of the year. But speaking at a conference in Iowa, Evans said: With the data I see today, my policy strategy would be to keep policy on hold until midyear or so in order to assess the incoming inflation data. If we get to that point and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted. In contrast, suppose inflation picks up more assuredly, as many expect. Then, we still could easily raise rates another three or even four times in 2018 if that were necessary. And I would support such a faster pace if the data point convincingly in this direction. Evans said he expected US GDP to grow between 2.5% and 2.75% this year, with growth slowing over the next two years as the boost from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts wears off. As for inflation, he expects it to rise gradually over the next few years: There is a hint that this may be in train today. Some inflation indicators over the past couple of months have been positive. I also am hearing a bit more commentary from manufacturers about higher commodity prices. While wage increases have been disappointingly low, the most recent data exhibit a firming trend. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently been hearing from more of my business contacts that firms are raising wages, giving additional bonuses, and boosting benefits. These are all positive signs for wage growth and clear signs of tighter labor markets. In my forecast, I expect inflation to rise gradually to our 2 percent target, perhaps reaching it in late 2019 or in 2020. But despite the indicators I just noted, I have not yet seen many actual increases in consumer prices. So, my forecast of reaching our target is still just a forecast. There is still a role for accommodative monetary policy to bring us back to our 2 percent inflation target. Evans voted against a rate rise in December but is a non-voting member this year, so his comments won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily hold much sway when it comes to the path of interest rates, although his reasoning is interesting. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The rout in stocks seen in the first two days of the week seems a long way away now, as a classic rebound in sentiment sees the Dow gain over 200 points within the first two hours, while the FTSE 100 continues to claw its way higher. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash on the sidelines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 theory gets a lot of stick these days, since who in their right mind would still hold cash when the market kept racing higher, but evidently equity investors (or their passive machine counterparts) have managed to scrimmage behind the sofa for some more funds in order to go bargain hunting in stock markets. While we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell what will happen next, the current course of events has mirrored previous market selloffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c brief panic, steady recovery and then a return to the longer-term rally. It is, after all, a bull market. The rebound in markets continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 311 points or 1.28%, while the FTSE 100 is 2.26% better, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 1.8% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 1.89%. Oil prices have come under pressure amid a rise in US crude stocks and a jump in US production. Opec and Russia have agreed output cuts to try and support crude prices, but there were concerns that US producers would step in to fill any shortfalls as the price rose. Last week the Energy Information Administration reported that US production rose by 332,000 barrels a day to a record high of 10.25m barrels a day. Meanwhile crude inventories rose by 1.9m barrels last week. Brent fell more than 0.8% on the news to $66.18, giving up all the gains made so far this year. The news from the US offset reports that the UK Forties pipeline was shut with no clear indication of when it would re-open. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest comments on the stock market. Dominic Rushe writes: The stock market is making a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Donald Trump said on Thursday, days after a record-breaking sell-off on the US exchanges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcold days,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump wrote on Twitter in his first public comment on the sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,175 points on Monday following another sharp fall last Friday. The drop appears to have been triggered by news of stronger than expected growth in wages which fueled expectations of a sharper rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Commenting on the markets on Tuesday White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the US economy was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Since his election Trump US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and global \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stock markets have hit a series of record highs. Trump has consistently pointed to rising stock markets as proof that his economic policies are working. The full report is here: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boasting about the rise in the US stock market came shortly before the crash, and he has been notably silent about it since then. Until now that is: The bounce on Wall Street has given an extra lift to European markets. The FTSE 100 is now up 105 points or 1.5%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has risen 0.9% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.8%. As a sign we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in for another volatile day, the Dow is now up 97 points. After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rollercoaster ride in US markets which ended with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 567 points and the S&amp;P 500 breaking a four day losing streak, Wall Street is heading lower again. As politicians scramble to put together a two year Budget plan that would prevent another government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down around 111 points but the decline was quickly reduced to just 29 points. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq Composite both opened down 0.32%. Ahead of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open, Federal Reserve voting member William Dudley says he believes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the markets are functioning quite well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But he also said: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is expected to show robust growth this year and next after a better than forecast performance in 2017, according to the European Commission. In its latest forecasts the Commission said both the eurozone and the wider EU saw GDP grow by 2.4% last year, better than the 2.2% and 2.3% respectively that it predicted in November. For 2018 the Commission expects a slowdown to 2.3%, although this is higher than the 2.1% it forecast in November. It is forecasting a further decline to 2% in 2019, but again this is higher than the November estimate of 1.9%. It said: This is a result of both stronger cyclical momentum in Europe, where labour markets continue to improve and economic sentiment is particularly high, and a stronger than expected pick-up in global economic activity and trade. On inflation it expected a modest pick-up next year: Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, is expected to stay subdued as labour market slack recedes only slowly and wage pressures remain contained. Headline inflation will continue to reflect the significant influence of energy prices and is forecast to rise modestly. Inflation in the euro area reached 1.5% in 2017. It is forecast to remain at 1.5% in 2018 and to increase to 1.6% in 2019. And more positivity about the markets for 2018, this time from Goldman Sachs: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bit of context for the recent market falls: James Swanson, Chief Investment Strategist at asset manager MFS, is also in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorrection not a crash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 crew. He argues that the economics fundamentals are solid, so shares shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep plunging. Conditions don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be in place for a prolonged market downturn. Corporate balance sheets remain strong, while fourth-quarter earnings have surpassed expectations. Additionally, the credit markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t signaling that a major shift in risk appetite has taken place. High-yield bond spreads have widened, but only marginally, from historically tight levels. Recent yield increases in non-investment-grade bonds have been driven more by rising Treasury rates than by growing credit concerns. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a source of comfort for equity investors. In just over an hour, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll discover if Wall Street agrees... London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is creeping higher, helping the FTSE 100 recover from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-month low. The Footsie is now at its daily high, up 80 points or 1.1%. That shows that some confidence has returned to the City. However, it still leaves shares down 6% so far this year. Financial stocks are leading the rally, with energy stocks and utilities also in demand. City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta remains cautious, though: Whilst we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this sell off to continue for an extended period of time, given that the fundamentals remain strong and unchanged, it is difficult to call the bottom and judge whether stocks have fallen sufficiently for investors to see value once again. After days of falls, Bitcoin is staging a rally today. The digital currency has bounced back up to $8,200, having hit a near-three month low below $6,000 on Tuesday. Bitcoin has been under pressure from regulators and politicians in recent weeks, keen to crack down on the use of digital currencies for money-laundering and reckless speculation. But Nigel Brahams, partner at London law firm Collyer Bristow, argues that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t write bitcoin off: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current situation is like the dot com boom and bust in the late 1990s, when cynics who couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face up to a changing world wrote off new online businesses too readily. The weak businesses and valueless coins will fail, but the really good projects like Ethereum and Bitcoin are here to stay, much like Amazon 20 years ago.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average is being called down 1%, when trading begins in three-and-a-half hour. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less fear in the markets today, but volatility remains high, says Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades. It is curious considering the fact that for years we were fighting against low inflation or even deflation and now this correction is generated by growing expectations of inflation in the US. American stock indices lead the recovery in the last few year and now they spread the uncertainty around the world. Investors who had wagered that the markets would remain calm have been burned by this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil. For example, those who bought a security from Japanese bank Nomura, which moved inversely to market volatility, have lost almost all their money. Bloomberg explains: Nomura Holdings Inc. issued an apology after investors in a $300 million product betting on low volatility were all but wiped out during this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market turmoil. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest brokerage said Wednesday that it has received inquiries from individual investors after its decision to redeem the exchange-traded notes at a 96 percent discount. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We sincerely apologize for causing significant difficulties to investors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its Nomura Europe Finance unit said in a statement a day earlier. Nomura\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Next Notes S&amp;P500 VIX Short-Term Futures Inverse Daily Excess Return Index ETN involved a bet against stock-market gyrations by moving in the opposite direction to a gauge of volatility. Its early redemption -- the first of its kind in Japan -- was triggered after the notes lost more than 80 percent of their value amid the global equity-market selloff. The bulls still have the upper hand over the bears on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floors today. After two hours trading, the main indices are all up, as investors hold their nerve. The FTSE 100 has dipped back a little, up 35 points at 7179. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is up 0.6%, while the Italian FTSE MIB has gained 0.9%. Shares may have found some support after recent losses, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a strong recovery. Analysts at FX Pro reckon investors are using the turmoil as a cautious buying opportunity: It may still be too early to talk about a return to growth or to celebrate another fast and easy victory of the bull market. Rather, it seems more likely that panicked selling will give way to more calculated portfolio rebalancing. Reuters have a good explanation for how computerised trading, and bets on low volatility, combined to cause this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem: It was a steep spike in yields last Friday that sparked the initial rout on Wall Street, forcing sales by a host of highly leveraged funds, which ramped up volatility and drove yet more selling. Many of these were algorithmic funds crowded into similar trades - long stocks and short volatility. The selling then cascaded through their computer systems in a way almost beyond human intervention. The pivotal gauge of S&amp;P 500 volatility, the VIX , did come off almost 20 points overnight but was still relatively elevated at 29.98 percent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Short volatility funds were caught by the spike in the VIX and had to cover,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a genius until you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not and when it takes just a day or two to unwind your whole strategy then you were never a genius,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But volatility does cluster, so there is no guarantee that markets are out of the woods yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Important news out of Berlin. Angela Merkel has reportedly reached a deal with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Social Democrats to create a new grand coalition. After overnight talks, the CDU/CSU and the SPD have broken the deadlock and hammered out a deal that - in principle - would return Merkel as chancellor, according to media reports from Germany. But... the SPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members still have to approve the plan. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll vote in the next few weeks. Intriguingly, it appears that the SPD could get control of the German finance ministry, and the foreign ministry. That could have significant impact on the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy -- Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next finance minister might take a less hard-line approach on issues such as debt relief and eurobonds, compared to Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble.... NEWSFLASH: UK house prices fell in January, according to the latest survey from Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices declined by 0.6% in the three months to January, following a 0.8% fall a month earlier. That takes the annual house price inflation rate down to 2.2%, compared with 2.7% in December. Halifax also found that fewer new homes are coming onto the market: New instructions to sell continued to deteriorate at the headline level and have now fallen for 23 consecutive months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the worst sequence for almost eight years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally means European stock markets are bucking a seven-day losing streak. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the turbulence is over. Many of the factors blamed for the sell off -- such as fears of US interest rate hikes -- are still in place. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities research team explains: Investors seem to believe that the worst is over and that the sell-off was just a market tantrum that happens a couple of times a year but we tend to believe that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more to come. As discussed above, the key catalysts behind the retreat in the equities markets have to do with the new reality in bond yields, concerns about a tighter Fed policy and doubts over the effectiveness of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms. It was quite a mixed day in Asia, by the end, as the initial optimism from Wall Street faded: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up across Europe, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not.... Supermarket chain Tesco isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t joining the rally, though. Its shares are down 1%, after shopworkers launched an equal pay claim that could prove very expensive. My colleague Sarah Butler has the story: Tesco is facing a demand for up to \u00c2\u00a34bn in back pay from thousands of mainly female shopworkers in what could become the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest ever equal pay claim. A law firm has launched legal action on behalf of nearly 100 shop assistants who say they earn as much as \u00c2\u00a33 an hour less than male warehouse workers in similar roles. Up to 200,000 shopfloor staff could be affected by the claim, which could cost Tesco up to \u00c2\u00a320,000 per worker in back pay over at least six years. Tesco warehouse staff earn from about \u00c2\u00a38.50 an hour up to more than \u00c2\u00a311 an hour while store staff earn about \u00c2\u00a38 an hour in basic pay, according to the claim. The disparity could mean a full-time distribution worker earning over \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year more than store-based staff. Markets are rising across Europe, as a degree of calm returns to trading floors. The Stoxx 600 index is up 0.7% - a modest, rather than spectacular recovery. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, says: Just as markets cannot keep rising forever, they must also stop falling at some point, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still unclear whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reached a level where buyers see value again. Futures prices had indicated a much brighter start for global markets, but early gains were wiped out in Asia and Europe looks vulnerable. Volatility is back, and investors had better get used to it. Shares are rising in London at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is up 65 points, or 0.9%, to 7205, as investors join the rally that began on Wall Street late last night. Pest control firm Rentokil is leading the risers, up 4.3%, followed by packaging firm Smurfit Kappa (+3.5%). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small rebound, compared to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.6% tumble. Mike van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets says traders can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decide whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical correction, or the opening sequence for a greater unwind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An unwind from a protracted period of historically low volatility, yields, borrowing costs and investor concern, which contributed to high levels of market valuation, passive investing, financial engineering and complacency. As the last few days have shown us, things are always \u00e2\u20ac\u0153different this time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, until of course, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not. Royal Bank of Canada is concerned that the early rally in Asia fizzled out as today wore on. US equities recovered some ground in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session after the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record losses. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 1.74% having lost over 4% the day before. The resurgence in volatility saw the VIX index hit an intraday high of over 50, a level not reached since 2015, having barely exceeded 15 for much of last year. Although Asian stock markets initially opened much higher on the back of the rebound in the US, that performance has faded. For example the Nikkei having been up as much as 3.4% on the day at one point is back to almost flat. Similarly, futures on US equity indices are sliding with the Dow off around 1% at the time of writing suggesting the sustainability of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound in sentiment isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assured at this stage. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European markets are rebounding this after two days of wild swings, but investors are still nervous. European stocks are tipped to bounce by at least 1% today, recovering some of Monday and Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp losses. That following a surprise late rally on Wall Street last night that saw the Dow jump by 567 points -- its biggest gain since Donald Trump was elected US president. Over in Asia, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has crept higher over night, but there were further losses in China. City traders are calling the FTSE 100 up 60 points today. That should please shareholders, until they remember that the blue-chip index shed almost 200 points on Tuesday, hitting a 10-month low. The other main European markets are expected to recover today as well. And worryingly, the futures market is suggesting that US stocks could fall back later today. So, it could be another volatile day....

And with the VIX sliding, the need for covering short options positions (many of which have now expired) is also easing, and that is providing support for topline stock benchmarks and headline market news impulses. </p> <p>Thus, the pain has subsided but this is not to say that reflation and the great Fed QE unwind haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turned the dial on market risk fundamentals, at the tail end of the secular stagnation phenomenon of weak productivity, a ballooning fiscal deficit and mounting private sector debt (despite weak investment and productivity). Investors now realise that the bond cycle has turned and, in a strong growth and inflation environment, high-grade equities are a safer place to be than high-grade long bonds (hence the breakdown in correlations between bonds and stocks). <br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a859e05e4b08a7971395262\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-15T14:55:52.961Z\">2.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US traders have joined the rally, driving shares higher and extending the recovery from last week.</p> <p>The Dow jumped some 215 points, with almost every company on the index gaining ground.</p> <p>Network equipment company Cisco is leading the charge, jumping 4.6% after beating earnings expectations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/964145116574339073\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dow rises more than 200 points at the open, tries for 5-day winning streak <a href=\"https://t.co/4FeO05oTkf\">https://t.co/4FeO05oTkf</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QEudF9dOXp\">pic.twitter.com/QEudF9dOXp</a></p>&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/964145116574339073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 15, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a859062e4b0c73a4284101a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-15T13:55:10.267Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Portfolio, on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/feb/15/stock-markets-investors-inflation-ftse-pound-us-jobs-factories-business-live?page=with:block-5a858d62e4b08a79713951b6#block-5a858d62e4b08a79713951b6\">the jump in US producer prices</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/wesbury/status/964134628104851456\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Producer prices up 0.4% in January, overall and core.

                "bodyText":"A late PS: Wall Street ended Thursday with fresh gains. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 306 points, or 1.2%, to end at 25,200. The S&amp;P also gained 1.2%, while the Nasdaq finished 1.8% higher. Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index, sums up the situation: Investors are piling back into equities after fears of higher interest rates and recent volatility have both eased. With the market showing signs of having carved out the bottom and optimism seemingly back on the agenda, bargain hunters are seeing this as a good time to jump in. And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest market report: World equity markets climbed on Wednesday as investors shrugged off the latest indication of rising U.S. inflation, while the dollar slipped to a 15-month low against the Japanese yen as strong global growth weighed on the U.S. currency. U.S. producer prices accelerated in January, according to a Labor Department report that offered further evidence that inflation pressures were building in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. The report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing a broad increase in U.S. consumer prices last month. An index of world stock markets advanced 0.8%, while major indices in Europe also rose, bolstered by strong results from heavy hitters such as Airbus, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest aerospace firm. Investors shrugged off fears of rising inflation and higher interest rates, bidding up shares of Apple Inc after Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berkshire Hathaway made the iPhone maker its top investment. Network gear maker Cisco also boosted indices on upbeat results and forecast. Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York, said he was encouraged by the reaction to the inflation data, which has overshadowed robust earnings, with about 80 percent of companies beating analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the midst of all the nervousness of the past two weeks, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re winding out a really strong earnings reporting season,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Grohowski said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There were a lot eyes fixating on the PPI number this morning, it came in a little hot. But much like yesterday, the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaking it off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And with the Dow now up a healthy 100 points, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to stop for the day. Goodbye! GW After a notably undramatic day, European stock markets have ended the day mostly higher. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the closing prices: Stoxx 600: up 1.7 points at 376.3 Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: up 20 points at 7234 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: up 7 points at 12,346 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: up 57 points at 5,219 David Madden of CMC Markets says there was a bit of profit-taking this afternoon: The FTSE 100, DAX and CAC 40 reached one week highs earlier today, but since then investors have been locking in their profits and now the FTSE 100 and DAX are in the red. The mood remains optimistic despite the small bit of selling we has seen lately. It would appears that we are slowly recovering from the major declines of last week. But...Standard Life Aberdeen had a rotten day. Its share finished down 7% as investors reacted to the loss of its biggest client, Scottish Widows. Ken Odeluga market analyst at City Index , says losing such a big client raises questions over the decision to merge Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life. Standard Life Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merger last year didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just give it an awkward name. Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that Lloyds Banking Group will pull \u00c2\u00a3109bn of asset management business reveals the cost of awkward structural problems created by Standard Life and Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tie-up last year. SLA said Lloyds accounted for less than 5% of 2017 revenues. The group could unveil turnover of \u00c2\u00a319.34bn, when it reports annual results next week. But the future hit should also include a \u00c2\u00a340m impairment charge. That means the eventual impact on SLA revenues could approach \u00c2\u00a3140m. If so, more than half of the \u00c2\u00a3200m annual cost savings the group projected from their merger would be erased. After two hours of trading, Wall Street remains up - although not by a huge amount. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both up around 0.25%, while the Nasdaq tech index has gained 0.6% (helped by Cisco). So, a calmer environment than last week. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that everything is back to normal. Lena Komileva, chief economist at (g+) economics, explains: A sliding VIX and a weak dollar have sent a much needed Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s week love letter to stocks. With the risks of a global recession and a systemic crisis low, investors sense that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s VIX jump over 50 marks the peak for now, and so the subsequent normalisation plus the monthly technical VIX expiration this week have invited algo-led trend-following strategies back into the markets. And with the VIX sliding, the need for covering short options positions (many of which have now expired) is also easing, and that is providing support for topline stock benchmarks and headline market news impulses. Thus, the pain has subsided but this is not to say that reflation and the great Fed QE unwind haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turned the dial on market risk fundamentals, at the tail end of the secular stagnation phenomenon of weak productivity, a ballooning fiscal deficit and mounting private sector debt (despite weak investment and productivity). Investors now realise that the bond cycle has turned and, in a strong growth and inflation environment, high-grade equities are a safer place to be than high-grade long bonds (hence the breakdown in correlations between bonds and stocks). US traders have joined the rally, driving shares higher and extending the recovery from last week. The Dow jumped some 215 points, with almost every company on the index gaining ground. Network equipment company Cisco is leading the charge, jumping 4.6% after beating earnings expectations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Portfolio, on the jump in US producer prices: Mark Hamrick of Bankrate.com is also concerned: Boom! US factories hiked their prices again last month, putting fresh pressure on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers to raise borrowing costs. The producer prices index rose by 0.4% during January, new figures from the Labor Department show. On an annual basis, the PPI jumped by 2.7% - up from 2.6% in December. The increase was driven by pricier gasoline, and healthcare services. Wall Street economists had only expected the annual PPI to rise by 2.5%, so this suggests inflationary pressures are building faster than expected. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly significant as we saw yesterday that consumer prices jumped by 0.5% last month. However, shares are still expected to open higher in New York in 45 minutes... Finally, the flurry of US economic data is coming through.... First up, the number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has risen to 230,000 last week, up from 223,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty low by historical standards, highlighting the strength of the US jobs market. As European traders munch into a quick lunchtime sandwich, the main indices are all up. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Buoyed by the resilience of the last few sessions the markets started to stretch their legs this Thursday, gradually clawing back some of the hefty losses seen in early February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bloodbath. The French stock market is leading the way, after new figures showed that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate fell below 9% at the end of 2017 for the first time in almost nine years. You know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quiet day when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at soybean futures. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good reason too! Soybean prices have hit their highest level since last July, due to concerns that Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crop will be disappointing. Argentina is gripped by a prolonged dry spell -- bad news for farmers in the Pampas grain belt looking to harvest their soybeans in the coming weeks. Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Tobin Gorey warns that Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soybean crops need \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soaking rain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd soon, but probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it. Weather forecasters are not expecting anything like soaking rain, nor a decline in high temperatures. We are expecting prices to gain further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The contract for soybeans to be delivered in March has jumped over $10.20 per bushel, a seven month high. Soybeans are a really important crop. They are used heavily in animal feeds, and also provide protein for use in vegetarian meals. So a jump in soybean prices can have a knock-on effect.... Volatility in the markets has fallen back today (possibly because, er..., there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great deal going on). The VIX volatility index has dropped by around 4% today to 18.5, its lowest level since shares started crashing nearly two weeks ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that investors are less nervous, having suffered a wobble last week over the prospect of interest rates being hiked to tackle inflation. Craig Erlam of City firm OANSA says: Volatility has remained quite elevated in recent sessions but we are slowly returning to more normal levels and are far from what we were experiencing last week. It would currently appear that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge was just a sharp correction in an otherwise bullish market, although it may be too soon to say that with any real confidence. Over in Greece former prime minister Antonis Samaras has announced that he has acted on his pledge to take legal action against current PM Alexis Tsipras. Samaras filed a suit against Tsipras today, accusing him of concocting what he described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrible conspiracy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of bribery claims involving the Swiss pharma giant Novartis. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In an unprecedented step, the former prime minister said he would be suing Tsipras because (he claims) it was clear the leftist-led government was bent on defaming its opponents with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aimed ultimately at dividing the Greek people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is responsible for the horrible conspiracy that is being put together,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Samaras arguing that between 2012 and 2015, his years in office, expenditure in the Greek public health sector, and on provision of drugs, had been dramatically reduced. Earlier this week, Tsipras called for a parliamentary inquiry into allegations, contained in a report compiled by anti-corruption prosecutors, that ten top former politicians, including two erstwhile premiers, had received millions of euros in bribes from Novartis in exchange for granting the company preferential treatment. Overpriced contracts in pursuit of profits at the expense of the Greek health system were among the accusations made by protected witnesses who testified before prosecutors. The state is believed to have lost as much as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4bn between 2006 and 2015 when the malpractice allegedly occurred. Samaras said the use of whistleblowers had also prompted him to take legal action because it set a dangerous precedent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the future every new government will be able to use coached informants to do away with political opponents.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But government officials said demands that the witnesses be revealed were preposterous. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the democratic history of our country it is unprecedented that judges should be accused of deliberately setting up a case, especially when we are talking about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-corruption prosecutor who we should all support,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Stelios Koulouglou, a euro MP representing Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Syriza party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the great economic scandals, like the Panama papers have been revealed thanks to the action of [protected] public witnesses .. they are the modern heroes of our times. There has to be protection of witnesses in our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Losing your biggest client is rarely good for your share price. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that asset management firm Standard Life Aberdeen is leading the FTSE 100 fallers today. Standard Life Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are down 5% this morning, after revealing that Scottish Widows (part of Lloyds Banking Group) is withdrawing its funds from the group. Scottish Life Aberdeen currently manages \u00c2\u00a3109 billion of Scottish Widows assets -- roughly a sixth of its total assets under management (however, the deal only generates around 5% of SLA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue) SLA say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisappointed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- Lloyds has jumped at the first opportunity to pull its funds, following a six-month transition period following the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management last year. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis is a blow for Standard Life Aberdeen, but has been on the cards ever since the merger. Standard Life and Scottish Widows are long standing rivals, and the prospect of one group managing the fund range of the other was never going to sit entirely comfortably in the corridors of power in Edinburgh. Losing this book of business would strike a sour note for the Standard Life Aberdeen merger, and undermines some of the rationale for joining forces, which was built on scale. However while almost a fifth of Standard Life Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets look like they might be walking out the door, this only equates to 5% of revenues, as these investment services are relatively low margin. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting the sort of funds involved are not run by the star managers of the stable, rather they are the sort of strategies that feature in older pension contracts sold under the Scottish Widows banner. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been a great morning for Laura Ashley. The homeware and clothing group -- famous for its floral prints in the 1980s - hit shareholders with another profit warning. Earnings almost halved in the second half of 2017, as my colleague Julie Kollewe explains: Sea\u00cc\ufffdn Anglim, Laura Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director, talked of an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overall toughening of the market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with like-for-like sales declines of 4.4% in furniture and 3.9% in decorating products such as fabrics, curtains and wallpaper. Shares slumped by 18% at one stage - or by 1.1p to a princely 5p. Despite being a well-known brand, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only worth around \u00c2\u00a344m these days. The pound has now risen to its highest level against the US dollar in two weeks, at $1.4070. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada think sterling is benefitting from signs that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on power is becoming a little less fragile. A recent poll put the Conservative party four points ahead of Labour, even though May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministers has been struggling to reach agreement on Brexit among themselves (let alone with the rest of the European Union...). Adam Cole of RBC warns, though, that sterling could suffer if May is replaced by Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the most vocal Brexiteers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose popularity has been rising in recent months as he has voiced opposition to a soft exit from the EU. Cole says: We note that prediction markets now have Labour and the Conservatives neck-and-neck as likely to be the largest party after the next election. At the turn of the year, there was a 10% point gap in the implied probabilities (55/45 in favour of Labour). The probability of this government serving its full five years has also risen to a new high (36%), though the risk of an earlier election is still high. Both of these developments have probably offered some support to GBP (sterling), though we also note that arch-Eurosceptic Rees-Mogg is now priced as most likely PM after May (ahead of Corbyn) and his hard Brexit line is probably less constructive for the currency. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest profile on the member for North East Somerset.... The pound and the euro are both rallying against the US dollar today. Sterling is up half a cent at $1.4047, while the euro has gained 0.3% to $1.249. You might have expected the dollar to benefit from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in US inflation (as a rise in interest rates makes it more profitable to hold dollars). Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says other factors are in play, though: A slightly higher-than-expected US CPI print was enough to get 10-year bond yields up to 2.92%, while equity and commodity prices both rallied sharply and the Vix [volatility index] fell back under 20. The dollar, on the other hand, got absolutely no support from any of this. A reminder if we needed that the better the global economic story, the worse it is for the dollar. The biggest single factor undermining the dollar this year has been the improvement in the global economy - a more balanced economic recovery drags investment away from the US and towards more interesting markets. European stock markets are gaining ground this morning, as traders shake off their recent jitters. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained around 37 points or 0.5%, to 7250. Mining firm Anglo American and investment group Old Mutual are leading the risers, up over 3%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both involved in South Africa, so are getting a boost from president Zuma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. The French stock market has jumped 1%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is up 0.6%. But what about those inflation worries? Shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong consumer prices data from America have spooked the markets, as it paves the way for higher interest rates? Apparently not. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because separate data from Wednesday showing a drop in US retail sales has persuaded investors that central bankers will tread cautiously. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: A soft retail number simply gives the message that consumers have started to ease off from their spending or they are not digging deep into their pockets. A sensible approach would be that the Fed isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to increase the interest rate when they can clearly see that the retail data was soft. A solid day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in Asia: South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is surging this morning, after president Jacob Zuma resigned. Zuma ended a long battle with his own party by stepping down last night, before a no confidence vote. Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa is now lined up to replace Zuma, whose tenure has been dogged by allegations of corruption and economic malaise. One of Ramaphosa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first tasks is to get South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 budget delivered next week. Ramaphosa is one of South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest men, and investors are hoping that he can turn the country around. The benchmark Top40 index has jumped by almost 3% today, extending its recent gains: But... Ramaphosa faces a massive challenge, as my colleague Jason Burke explains: Cape Town, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second city, is running out of water. According to government statistics, the total number of people living with HIV increased from an estimated 4.72 million in 2002 to 7.03 million by 2016, though the rate of infection is declining. Unemployment remains at an historic high of 27.7% across the general population, and as high as 68% among young people. Economic growth has been limited in recent years, averaging little more than half the rate of population growth of 1.2%. Zuma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure has sent the rand surging and will spur a rush of much-needed foreign investment. China and South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are closed today, as traders celebrate the Lunar New Year. Trading volumes have been lighter across Asia, which may be aiding the sense of calm in the markets. But Rob Carnell, chief Asia economist at ING, sounds most unconvinced that this tranquility will last...... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having just gone through the roller coaster of equity sell-off induced by bond yield rises, I am frankly at a loss to explain what is now happening. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can only assume that we are in a temporary lull before the turmoil returns. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil, investors seem to have rediscovered their appetite for risk. Asia-Pacific stock markets are rallying across the board, with Japan and Australia both up around 1%. Associated Press have the details: Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 1.5% to 21,464.98 and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 climbed 1.2% to 5,909.00. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng advanced 2% to close at 31,115.43 in a half-day trading session. Indexes in Southeast Asia, New Zealand and India also rose. European markets are also expected to rise, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, as the City looks to put recent volatility behind it. The markets have also shaken off Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly strong inflation data. As we covered yesterday, shares were briefly hit after US consumer prices jumped by 0.5% last month, but in the end the Dow Jones finished the day up 1%. Higher inflation raises the pressure on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers, particularly those at the Federal Reserve, to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates. That would be bad for bond prices, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably a mistake to assume the markets have calmed down now. As Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Whilst the market is showing signs of carving out a bottom and the volatility index (VIX) or fear gauge, has dropped back below 20, after peaking at over 50 just last week, it is unlikely that this is the last we have seen of the volatility as markets claw back these recent losses. Today, investors will be looking at the latest American weekly unemployment figures, and new data showing how US factories fared last month, and how their prices changed. Plus, several European Central Bank policymakers are giving speeches today, which might move the markets. The agenda: 8.15am GMT: ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Yves Mersch speaks in Paris 10.45am GMT: ECB Peter Praet speaks at the French finance ministry 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 1.30pm GMT: US producer prices data for January 2.15pm GMT: US industrial production for January",

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a closing summary: Toys R Us and Maplin have entered administration on the same day, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk at two of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-known retailers. Administrator Moorfields said it was managing an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orderly wind-down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Toys R Us, which has about 3,000 staff, while PwC has been appointed to oversee the administration of Maplin, which employs 2,500 people. Labour called on the government to hold urgent talks with trade unions and the companies to ensure that jobs are safeguarded and address weakness in the retail sector. Moorfields said it still holds out hope of finding a last-minute buyer for all or part of Toys R Us, with its newer stores most likely to attract interest. Simon Thomas, a partner at Moorfields, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All stores remain open until further notice and stock will be subject to clearance and special promotions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re encouraging customers to redeem their gift cards and vouchers as soon as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said adding that customers should do so as soon as possible, before any store closures take effect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst this process is likely to affect many Toys R Us staff, whether some or all of the stores will close remains to be decided. We have informed employees about the process this morning and will continue to keep them updated on developments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story, which will be updated later. Good night, and good luck to those 5,500 employees. GW This piece may be useful for customers: Investors who loaned money to Toys R Us face significant losses. As Alan Higgins, the CIO of Cootts, points out, Toys R Us bonds were trading close to their face value until last summer - when the US parent sought bankruptcy protection. Over in the City of London, the FTSE 100 index of top shares has closed down 50 points or 0.7% at 7231. The selloff was mainly due to worries that American interest rates are going to rise sharply this year. But the problems at Toys R Us and Maplin did cast a shadow over traders. Consumer cyclical stocks fell 0.5%, while non-cyclicals fell almost 1%. Among smaller companies, Mothercare slumped 9% to a new all-time low of just 28.35p (back in 2010 they were worth over \u00c2\u00a35). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twin administrations show that retailers are suffering badly. Other casualties could follow, she fears. Firstly, the squeeze on the consumer thanks to elevated levels of inflation, combined with wage declines in real term, which is causing consumers to rein in their spending on damaging level. And secondly, this reining back in spending couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have come at a worst time in the high street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history, as consumer habits change towards online shopping, favouring the likes of Amazon for their fast delivery and wider selection and more competitive pricing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This brutal combination is hitting the high street hard. Stores are struggling at best, but if in the case of Toys R\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 US there is excessive additional burdens, then survival is questionable. It is very unlikely that these two retail giants will be the last casualties on the higher street, quite the opposite. With the online shopping revolution in full swing and tough economic conditions set to continue for the UK in the face of Brexit, there is a very good probability that more victims will fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Heads-up: That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen as usual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sign outside Toys R Us in Manchester isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as new as I thought, sorry.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chilly corner of intu Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley, near Birmingham, that captures today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim retail news. There, a Maplin and a Toys R Us store sit, side by side - with a sign in one of the windows confirming that the administrators are now in charge. Reader Shaukat Abbas kindly sent me these photos: Over in Manchester, my colleague Frances Perraudin has been speaking to Maplin customers about its fall into administration this morning (reminder, she visited Toys R Us earlier) She writes: Coming out of a small Maplin store on Manchester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oxford Road, student Jack Poulton was clear that the business has been a victim of the rise of e-commerce. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of the products that they sell, a lot of people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially younger generations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will now look online for,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only reason I came in today is its proximity to the university and because I needed something immediately, otherwise I would have gone online myself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Poulton had visited the shop, which has been on the same site for more than 30 years, to see if they stocked a specific magnifying lens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the manager knew instantly where to look. I would have no complaints about the service. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to find what they sell in Maplin on Amazon these days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fellow student Mike Ellis said it was a shame that the expertise held by staff at electrical shops like Maplin was being lost. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes you just want to be given advice, which these guys are very well trained for. Without that you are suddenly on your own.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Inside the tidy and well-ordered store this lunch time, the staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who usually outnumbered customers three-to-one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c said they could not speak to the press, but confirmed that they had heard the news about the business that morning. Aslam Malik, who works for Manchester city council, popped in on his way past, after hearing that the company was going into administration, to see if they had a cheap DVD player for his nephew. He did not find what he was looking for. He aded: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What they sell is quality stuff, but they are very expensive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can buy a printer for \u00c2\u00a320 or \u00c2\u00a330 from Tesco and Asda these days. I would usually look on ebay and at the big supermarkets for things like that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Update: I incorrectly wrote earlier that the Toys R Us branch in Manchester has hung an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen as usual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sign outside. A reader has now got in touch, to kindly explain that the sign has been there for a while (!). Apologies... Toy sellers have been hit by a triple-whammy of problems recently, which all contributed to Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predicament. The slump in the pound after the Brexit vote has driven up costs, while the growth of electronic devices, and the rise of counterfeit goods have eaten into sales. Amisha Chohan, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales in the UK toy market fell by 2.8% to \u00c2\u00a33.4bn in 2017, according to the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) and the NPD Group. This has been driven by a number of reasons; there has been a shift to screen games as opposed to physical toys. Licenses have been under-performing for a while, and there is the ever-growing concern of counterfeit toys. As with all retailers, toy shops have also been impacted by the shift to online sales. The impact of Brexit on the strength of the Sterling (particularly last year), together with inflationary pressures such as the increase in minimum wage, has also made a significant dent into their margins.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin into administration is going to ripple through the UK retail sector - and hurt companies in their supply chain. Helena Kanczula, Corporate Tax Director at accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg, explains that some suppliers will be left with unpaid bills. There is an order of priority regarding who ranks above who when a company goes into liquidation and trade creditors would be below secured creditors such as banks and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees. There may therefore be limited funds available to distribute to suppliers. Research from YouGov has shown that the UK public lost confidence in Toys R Us after its US parent limped into bankruptcy protection last autumn. Amelia Brophy, Head of Data Products UK at YouGov, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Certainly, in the UK at least, people recognised the struggles the brand was experiencing. Its Buzz score (whether you have something positive or negative about a brand) had lingered around the +2 mark prior to September 2017. Since that time, its score has plummeted to a low point of -25. The knock-on effect of this is that the public opinion deteriorated. Its Impression score, which had stood around the +16 mark, dropped as low as -1. Most damaging of all of course, it that fewer people felt that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d consider shopping with Toys R US. Its Purchase Consideration (would you consider buying something from a brand) score among the general public had declined to +9 prior to the news it has entered administration, where once it had averaged a more respectable +15. It would have been hoping that the Christmas trading period would have injected some life back into the business, but our data indicates that it struggled to attract customers in the same way it once had, with only a small rallying in Impression score and Buzz. This is despite its Ad Awareness score jumping to +17, which does compete with previous years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 levels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The British arm of Toys R US has been struggling since its US parent company filed for bankruptcy protection last September. The UK arm kept operating, in the hope of finding a buyer. That sounds laudable, but Philip Marshall QC of Serle Court argues that creditors could now lose out. The list of creditors includes the government (through its unpaid \u00c2\u00a315m VAT bill) and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pensions protection scheme (which picks up a \u00c2\u00a337m deficit). Marshall explains why some tough questions need to be asked: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the face of it one might say it is a surprise that the administration of the UK subsidiary of Toy R Us did not come sooner given the insolvency of its parent in the US some months ago and the well known difficulties of high street retailers in the face of online rivals. One question that may need proper investigation is whether the board acted properly in deferring administration in the face of market pressures (and ongoing losses) in the hope of securing a sale. Given that there is apparently a deficit to both the Revenue and Pension Protection Fund the outcome for trade creditors cannot be good and they may wish a proper investigation to be undertaken by the administrators to determine whether there is culpability here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Toys R Us nearly collapsed last December, before the company agreed to inject an extra \u00c2\u00a39m into its pension fund. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration means Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pension Protection Fund takes over the scheme, which currently has a \u00c2\u00a337m black hole. Ian Browne, pension specialist at Old Mutual Wealth, says existing pensioners will be protected, while current workers will lose some of their pension pot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Members of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension schemes need not panic. When schemes collapse they fall into the hands of the PPF, who have the responsibility for paying workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pensions. Those who already reached the scheme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal pension age will receive 100% of their pension. For those who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached the normal pension age, the PPF will pay 90% of what their pension is worth, up to a cap. This cap is currently just over \u00c2\u00a338,500 per year for someone retiring at 65, so it only affects the highest earners. Members of the scheme can still take early retirement and a tax-free cash lump sum. In fact, the way PPF calculates these can sometimes be more generous than a typical scheme. The problems at Toys R Us show that the era of retail parks may be over. So argues Dr Gordon Fletcher, retail expert at the University of Salford Business School. He says large out-of-town retail parks fail to meet customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With ToysRUs and Maplin going into administration today, the constant change in the retail sector is now being felt in retail parks as much as the high street. These familiar brands have struggled to keep pace with the growing preference for online retail. But it is not just a matter of more people buying online, it is also what these retailers offered as their customer experience. Visiting a toystore with children is generally a fraught experience for most adults. Combined with the fact that a planned visit to a toystore will often require a degree of secrecy from the very same children, the failure of Toys R Us becomes much clearer. With a business model that imitated a grocery superstore that relied primarily on offering competitive pricing points in out-of-town locations there were few opportunities to discover something new or to create an environment that encouraged adult drivers to linger as long as their children wanted to. Our North of England reporter Frances Perraudin reports from a Toys R Us store in Manchester: Late on Wednesday morning, removal men Mark Connor and John Banks have popped into a tired looking Toys \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Us store on the outskirts of Manchester city centre for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nostalgia trip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a relic from the 80s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last time I came here, I was playing with transformers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Connor is keeping his eye out for Lego or Star Wars toys for his five-year-old son, but despite this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that the company would be going into administration, he says prices at the shop in the Ancoats area of the city are still too high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just compared one item they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got over there to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on ebay and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a340 there and you can get it for \u00c2\u00a315 online.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think toy shops like this put smaller toy shops out of business, so I personally think [the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse] might actually give the smaller toy shops a bit of a niche market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Connor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing, because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never a good thing when a big company goes out of business because loads of people lose their jobs, but it might regenerate a local toy shop mentality and help local businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The 30,000 square foot store was earmarked for closure before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, as the area is in line for redevelopment. On Wednesday morning only a small handful of customers could be seen wandering through its aisles of garish toys, with around 15 members of staff standing huddled chatting near the tills. Mike Meszaros, who works in branding, has come into the store to find an outfit for his son for World Book Day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I remember coming in here when I was seven years old and it was busy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d come in and it was like Hamley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have staff demonstrating the toys. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have stuff set up that you could play with and there would be toys everywhere that you could use before you bought them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like that now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite sad really.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour MP Peter Kyle says Maplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration shows the wider impact of the weak pound on UK firms who import goods. Far from ushering in a bright economic future, the threat of Brexit has put jobs and investment at risk. Adam Deacock, a Barrister at Radcliffe Chambers, fears it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be possible to save all Toys R Us and Maplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores. He explains: The administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statutory task is to rescue a company and its business as a going concern if this is possible. In practical terms this is highly unlikely, as a buyer will be unlikely to wish to take over their debts and liabilities or all of their stores, so the administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 next task is to attempt to get the most they can for the assets. The hope for the companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 5,500 employees is that a buyer can be found for the businesses who will take over as many as possible of the stores, their employees and their pensions in one go, but the administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concern is simply to produce the best result for creditors. Deacock points out that the UK government could be hit in the pocket: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As taxpayers we should all be concerned as the immediate cause of Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 administration appears to be its unpaid VAT bill of \u00c2\u00a315m and other unpaid tax debts can be expected. Another interesting tweet from Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien, suggesting that Amazon will profit from Maplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems: Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien of UK Research Director at Global Data Retail reckons that Smyths, Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest toy retailer, was at least partly responsible for Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise. Smyths has been expanding in the UK recently, and almost doubled its UK pre-tax profits last year. It has offered a range of bargain toys, aimed at shoppers on a budget. Pat Lynes, business transformation expert and founder of Sullivan &amp; Stanley, fears that more retailers will follow Maplin and Toys R US. Lynes pins the blame on outdated management who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adjusted to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business conditions: Toys R Us and Maplin facing collapse is sadly not surprising. They haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t re-engineered their operating model to focus on digital platforms and the customer experience. A lot of executives of these older corporations are sitting within organisational structures that were fit for the nineties and maybe the noughties, but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid-pace, changing world. Without the ability to adapt quickly, sales will slide. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same Blockbuster story repeating - how many others will be next? Another example of why high street stores such as Maplin will be missed. Dr Coxon now works at Cambridge University, making silicon solar cells more efficient, so those projects clearly paid off. PwC have confirmed that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken control of Maplin, and are looking for a buyer for some, or all, of the company. They also say that Maplin was hurt by the fall in sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which slumped against rival currencies after the Brexit vote in June 2016. Zelf Hussain, joint administrator and PwC partner, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The challenging conditions in the UK retail sector are well documented. Like many other retailers, Maplin has been hit hard by a slowdown in consumer spending and more expensive imports as the pound has weakened. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our initial focus as administrators will be to engage with parties who may be interested in acquiring all or part of the company. We will continue to trade the business as normal whilst a buyer is sought. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Staff have been paid their February wages and will continue to be paid for future work while the company is in administration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dom Tribe, retail sector specialist at supply chain firm, Vendigital, says Toys R Us failed to keep pace with changing shopping habits, including internet retail. Despite losing significant market share to competitors such as Amazon and Argos, Toys R Us failed to implement an effective E-commerce model with expedited shipping options and also continued to rely on its large warehouses. Opened in the 1980s and 90s, these have proven highly costly to run, with difficulties around managing stock levels, and have been outperformed by its new smaller stores. Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 relationships with key suppliers also hit the headlines over the last year, with the chain demanding long payment terms and exclusivity on certain ranges despite no longer being the key player in the market. Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff has written a good thread about why the collapse of toy stores matters: City analyst Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says retailers are suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153structural game-changers and a softening in consumer confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which can be fatal for firms who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adjusted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toys R Us has officially entered administration, with stores to remain open for the time being. The company failed to adapt and was stuck with a large portfolio of large warehouse shops. No experience for customers, no compelling online presence. A \u00c2\u00a315m VAT bill did for Toys R Us in the end after another poor Christmas, but it was a systemic failure to move with the changes in the retail sector that really did for it. Maplin has also gone into administration in what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a pretty torrid day for UK retail. In both cases the Amazon effect is all too clear to see, but there is more to it than that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are retailers out there who are adapting and prospering. He also points out that Mothercare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen today (currently down 7%, having been 12% lower earlier). Maplin, like Toys R Us, has struggled in the face of online retailers who were able to undercut its prices. But if the company does disappear from the high street, shoppers may struggle to lay their hands on a particular cable, battery or peripheral at short notice: Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, is urging the government to help Maplin and Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devastating that over 5,500 High Street jobs risk being lost. This latest shock in the retail sector continues a worrying trend for our shopping streets and centres. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government must urgently meet with both the unions and the companies to ensure that these jobs are safeguarded. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Workers are suffering stress and anxiety not knowing what the future holds for them. In the event of job losses, the Government must act quickly to ensure all workers receive swift redundancy payments and are properly supported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government must also urgently address problems across the retail sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BREAKING: Electrical goods chain Maplin has also fallen into administration, in an increasingly dark morning for UK retail. This puts around 2,500 jobs at risk. Maplin, which has over 200 stores in the UK, was forced into administration after failing to find new funding -- less than an hour after Toys R US suffered the same fate. Graham Harris, CEO of Maplin, has blamed the slump in the pound since the EU referendum, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can confirm this morning that it has not been possible to secure a solvent sale of the business and as a result we now have no alternative but to enter into an administration process. During this process Maplin will continue to trade and remains open for business. The business has worked hard over recent months to mitigate a combination of impacts from sterling devaluation post Brexit, a weak consumer environment and the withdrawal of credit insurance. This necessitated an intensive search for new capital that in current market conditions has proved impossible to raise. These macro factors have been the principal challenge not the Maplin brand or its market differentiation. We believe passionately that Maplin has a place on the high street, and that our trust, credibility and expertise meets a customer need that is not supported elsewhere. We will now work tirelessly alongside Zelf Hussain, Toby Underwood and Ian Green, from PWC, who have been appointed as the as Joint Administrators of Maplin Electronics Limited, to achieve the best possible outcome for all of our colleagues and stakeholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A whopping VAT tax bill helped to push Toys R Us over the edge. The company owed \u00c2\u00a315m, and a disappointing Christmas trading performance left it without enough funds to pay - triggering its fall into administration. Time for some nostalgia with Geoffrey the Giraffe, who starred in Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s iconic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMagical Place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advert back in 1989: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Davies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breaking news story on Toys R Us: Toys R Us staff discovered earlier this morning that their employer has fallen into administration. Moorfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partner Simon Thomas, who is now running Toys R Us, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have informed employees about the process this morning and will continue to keep them updated on developments. We are grateful for the commitment and hard work of employees as the business continues to trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for Toys R Us customers and staff, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s undoubtedly distressing news for employees of Toys \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Us especially because their fates have been uncertain for so long. Unfortunately they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only retailer that has been struggling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone who is worried about the future of their job should prepare themselves now. Check what redundancy rights you have and dig out any income or mortgage protection policies you hold just in case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toys \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Us have reported they will continue trading for now, however it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently unknown whether they will still accept gift vouchers and offer refunds. If the administrators decide to suspend gift vouchers and refunds and you paid in cash you could be in for a lengthy battle to get your money back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her guide explaining how credit card spending is protected in the UK: How does Section 75 protect your credit card spending? Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, says Toys R Us is another victim of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seismic structural changes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hitting the UK high streets (such as rising operating costs and the threat from online retailers). He adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Put simply, the retailer was too slow to embrace omnichannel, were burdened with too many stores and failed to deliver a retail \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexperience\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 good enough to stand out from their competitors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administrators haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hopes of finding a buyer, for at least some of its 100+ outlets. In the meantime, existing stock will probably be offered at a sharp discount: Toys R Us customers are being urged to cash in any vouchers and gift cards ASAP, following its collapse into administration this morning. Toys R US has been dragged into administration by its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unmanageable rent bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to the Financial Times. It says: Executives had been battling to raise cash to pay a tax liability that fell due this week, but the efforts collapsed after a number of private equity funds and restructuring specialists walked away. Insolvency specialists at Moorfields have begun the process of closing its British operations, which employ nearly 3,000 people and has an estimated funding shortfall of at least \u00c2\u00a325m in its pension scheme. Retail analyst Fiona Paton points out that several other retailers have gone under recently: NEWSFLASH: Retailer Toys R Us has fallen into administration, putting around 3,000 jobs at risk. Press Association has the details: Administrator Moorfields has been appointed to conduct what it called an orderly wind-down of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s store portfolio, although the firm insisted it is still seeking a buyer. Simon Thomas, Moorfields partner, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will be conducting an orderly wind-down of the store portfolio over the coming weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All stores remain open until further notice and stock will be subject to clearance and special promotions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re encouraging customers to redeem their gift cards and vouchers as soon as possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Toys R Us retailer has been hunting for a buyer for several weeks, but without success. The company, which has 105 stores in the UK, is a subsidiary of the eponymous US company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada last year after amassing $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.7bn) of debt. More to follow.... Asia-Pacific markets have closed lower, with Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index down 2%, China off nearly 0.9% and Australia losing 0.7%. London-focused estate agent Foxtons has blamed a plunge in profits on Brexit uncertainty and stamp duty changes that have driven sales in the capital to near record lows. The company said waning consumer confidence against a backdrop of political uncertainty was weighing on the London housing market, driving a 65% fall in pre-tax profits in 2017 to \u00c2\u00a36.5m. Foxtons said changes to rules in 2016, when the government imposed a new stamp duty surcharge on second homes, had also contributed to a weaker market and falling profits. Nic Budden, the chief executive, warned 2018 would be another tough year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are pleased to have delivered a performance in line with market expectations. However, sales activity in the London property market is near historic lows and this had a significant impact on our overall performance in 2017. UK broadcaster ITV has slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after reporting a 10% drop in earnings. Statutory pre-tax profits fell to \u00c2\u00a3500m last year, from \u00c2\u00a3553m in 2016, highlighting the tough market for advertising. ITV blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertain economic environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is overshadowing new CEO Carolyn McCall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrategic refresh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It has also stopped paying a special dividend to shareholders (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still getting a normal divi, though). McCall sounds confident about the future, saying: We have a solid foundation to build on, and a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows gives ITV the flexibility to make the right strategic decisions for the long term future of ITV in an increasingly competitive environment whilst still delivering sustainable returns to shareholders. The prospect of several US interest rate rises this year has also hit American government bonds. As the price of US Treasuries has fallen, the yield (or interest rate) on the bond has risen. If borrowing costs are indeed going up, then investors want a higher return on their money. This means the gap between US and eurozone bonds has hit its widest level since the euro was created. European stock markets are all falling in early trading, as investors react to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony from Fed chair Jerome Powell. The main indices are all down around 0.5% - a modest move, but one that highlights the worries about US interest rates. In London, the FTSE 100 has been pulled down by mining stocks. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re suffering because Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat comments have boosted the US dollar (thus pushing down commodity prices, which are priced in dollars). Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undeniable optimism towards the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and his hawkish comments on interest rate moves, is hurting the markets, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Due to Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong outlook on the US economy, he considers it necessary to continue gradually increasing interest rates in order to prevent the US economy from overheating. On his hawkish tone, when asked the million-dollar question about 3 hikes or 4, Powell was quick to point out the improvements in the economy and his optimism that inflation will reach the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target, in what can only be described as a hawkish response, which to many signalled 4 hikes could be on the cards in 2018. Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments unleashed a wave of anxiety among equity traders, who rushed to sell out of holdings. Vive la France! Statistics body INSEE has just raised its forecast for French growth last year to 2%, up from 1.9%. That confirms that 2017 was the best year for France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy since 2011. INSEE also confirmed that GDP rose by 0.6% in the last three months of 2017, matching its initial estimate. With all this talk about interest rate rises, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that America doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have an inflation problem right now.... Stock markets across Asia have all fallen today, after Fed chair Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish comments reignited interest rate hike fears. The Japanese and Hong Kong indices are leading the selloff, down 1,5% each. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Cautious investors are taking a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guarded approach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM: It is becoming increasingly clear that global stocks still remain highly sensitive to the prospects of rising inflation and interest rate fears. With Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony fuelling market speculation of higher US interest rates this year, stock markets remain exposed to downside risks as equity bears lurk in the background. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders have one thing on their mind today (well two, if you include the snow gripping the capital). How many US interest rates rises are heading our way, and how will the markets cope? For this, we can thank the new head of the Federal Reserve. As we covered in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog, Fed chair Jerome Powell struck an upbeat tone about the US economy when he faced Congress yesterday. Powell told US lawmakers that he has become more optimistic about the US economic outlook since December, predicting some good years ahead with rising wages growth. If he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for Americans, but potentially bad news for investors as the Fed is more likely to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation running out of control. The big fear in the markets is that the Fed could squeeze four rate hikes into 2018, ending the era of cheap money. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: A hawkish Jay Powell indicated US interest rates set to continue to rise in his first public outing as Federal Reserve Chair, prompting many to expect four rate hikes this year rather than three. Shares fell on Wall Street last night after Powell spoke, triggering losses in Asia overnight - and likely falls in Europe today. The FTSE 100 has just opened, down 36 points at 7245. Also coming up today: There could be Brexit fireworks , as the EU publishes the first draft of the withdrawal treaty. This may bring the sticky question of the Irish border into renewed focus - Theresa May has already declared that she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign anything that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153threatens the integrity of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 There could be drama in UK retail too, with Toys R Us and Maplin both on the brink of administration. On the economic side, we get updated growth figures from the US and France, plus the first estimate of eurozone inflation .
