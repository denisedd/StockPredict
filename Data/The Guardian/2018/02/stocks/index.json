And, luckily for the ailing dollar, the numbers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint: the headline figure came in at 200k, far higher than both the 181k expected and the 160k posted in January, with wage growth also outperforming forecasts to remain unchanged at 0.3%. </p> <p>This, alongside a better than expected consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan, allowed the dollar to regain some ground lost this week. Against the pound the greenback rose 1%, sending cable back below $1.413, while against the euro the dollar jumped 0.7%, taking the currency away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.25-crossing 3 and a bit year peak. </p> <p>All this hawkishness was toxic for the Dow Jones, which plunged 300 points once the bell rang on Wall Street to hit 25900 for the first time in over a fortnight. This Dow drop only exacerbated the losses in Europe; the DAX and CAC both fell 1.3%, with the former on track for its worst close since September last year, while the FTSE slipped 0.7% to strike a sub-7450, near 8 week nadir. </p> <p>As for Bitcoin, while things are still bad, they are nowhere near as disastrous as they were at lunchtime. It had at one point found itself trading at $7750, a price not seen since the end of November, only for a wave of buyers to rescue it from those lows and send it back above $8650.

However chief economist Richard Curtin was positive about the overall picture:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumer sentiment has remained largely unchanged for more than a year at very favorable levels. The January Sentiment figure was just 0.2 Index-points below December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and just 1.1 points below the 2017 average of 96.8--which was the highest yearly average since 2000. Stock price increases and the passage of tax reforms were mentioned by all-time record numbers of consumers. To be sure, there were small offsetting declines among lower income households and residents of the Northeast.</p> <p> Consumers continued to expect growth in jobs and incomes, but anticipated a slightly higher inflation rate. Importantly, the motivating force behind purchase decisions has shifted from discounts on prices and interest rates to increased confidence in future job security and growth in wages as well as financial assets. This renewed sense of confidence was responsible for the recent declines in savings rates. </p> <p>he tax cuts will increase discretionary spending once higher energy bills due to the unusually cold weather are paid. Monetary policy will need to tighten in the year ahead, but given consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decade long experience with record low interest rates, only modest increases in interest rates will be sufficient to curb any excesses. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.8% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adb63510534613fbe208a5edfd1042dcd253cc8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adb63510534613fbe208a5edfd1042dcd253cc8d/0_0_1086_697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"umichconf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:17:57.886Z\">at 3.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a747ebee4b0460af94bf3d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:08:18.051Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The upbeat consumer confidence figures have sent Wall Street even lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 300 points or more than 1.1%.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:09:09.172Z\">at 3.09pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a747dfce4b0839ae39a8542\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:07:02.916Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US consumer confidence remains strong</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More positive news for the US economy, adding to the belief that the Federal Reserve will be ready to raise interest rates next month.</p> <p>The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 95.7 in January, up from an initial reading of 94.4 and better than the expected figure of 95.

These are relatively small moves and based on recent experience, the mostly likely scenario is dip-buyers step in to send markets back up again. However, maybe this time will be different.

Economist James Knightley says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US jobs report is very strong with payrolls rising 200,000 versus expectations of 180,000. There were some chunky upward revisions too, but the big story is wage growth which looks much, much better. Wages are now growing 2.9% year on year (the fastest rate of growth since 2009) with last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised up to 2.7% from 2.5%. Unemployment stays at 4.1%, but given the strength of this report it is hard to argue against a March Fed rate hike now.</p> <p>Wage growth has been the missing link in the strong economic growth, tight jobs market story. We have been hoping for some time to see a turnaround and it does finally look as though something is happening. It backs up evidence from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Federation of Independent Businesses small business survey, which showed the net proportion of businesses raising worker compensation is at its highest since 2000. The report also showed you have to go all the way back to 1989 to find when the index indicating the net proportion of businesses that plan to raise worker pay was higher. </p> <p>Given companies such as WalMart have credited Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts as a way for them to afford higher worker pay we suspect we will see the wage numbers pick-up further. Rising wages and robust economic growth is also supportive for our 3% headline CPI call for this summer.</p> <p>Consequently, it will need a big shock to prevent the Fed from hiking in March, but it could happen in the form of a damaging government shutdown should politicians fail to resolve their differences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next deadline is February 8.

Given there are about 2bn tether coins in existence, there should be a $2bn account somewhere but Tether has yet to prove it or have accounts audited.</p> <p>The idea that Tether is creating coins to buy bitcoin is straight out of satire. If bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then this is Ponzi squared; printing fake money to buy a different type of fake money in order to ramp up the price of the latter. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to cause real world losses for many investors it would be hilarious.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we see the jaws of the regulatory crunch closing on other fronts with moves to ban or greatly restrict trading on bitcoin gaining traction worldwide. Ultimately if the CFTC decides bitcoin prices have been manipulated it casts a huge shadow of bitcoin and entire crypto market.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>At Davos last week, a series of experts cast doubt over bitcoin -- those predictions seem to be being born out today....</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/25/bitcoin-wont-last-in-world-of-finance-warns-nobel-winning-economist\">Bitcoin won't last in world of finance, warns Nobel-winning economist</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a745026e4b0460af94bf160\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T11:56:58.691Z\">11.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bitcoin tumbles through $8,000</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ouch!

This would boost small businesses, and tackle the uncompetitive nature of the current outsourcing market. It would also protect the government from another Carillion crisis.</p> <p>Secondly, public contracts should not be awarded solely on the basis of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value for money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Government contracts should be seen as an opportunity to create public value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where value is understood in holistic rather than narrow economistic terms. The government should account for the wider economic and social impact of its suppliers when determining which supplier should be awarded a particular contract. The Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals to account for the quantity and quality of employment created by a supplier, the nature of its corporate governance, its environmental impact and its attitude towards tax suggests how this could be done.</p> <p>Thirdly, we need to call time on private financing. If the government wants to build a major infrastructure project it should do so through historically cheap public borrowing, on the public balance sheet, justifying the investment based on the economic, social, or environmental impact. Good public investment done well more than pays for itself in the long run. It should also expand its definition of investment to include investment in human as well as physical capital \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spending on healthcare and education is just as much of an investment in the long-run economic capacity of this country as investments in roads and bridges.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2018/02/problem-outsourcing-not-carillion-market-itself\">The problem with outsourcing is not Carillion but the market itself</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a743884e4b0839ae39a81dc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T10:12:34.890Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Carillion: 377 staff made redundant</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NEWSFLASH: Nearly 400 Carillion staff have just been made redundant, following its fall into liquidation last month.</strong></p> <p>The Official Receiver says it has managed to save more than 900 jobs, but 377 more have lost their jobs.

                "bodyText":"New York traders will be catching their breath and counting their losses after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines. So, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our updated news story on the markets today: Wall Street ended its worst week in two years on Friday with another sharp fall as markets in Europe also continued to tumble from the record-high levels reached less than a month ago. Investors headed for the exits amid growing fears over a bond market rout, triggered by early signs of inflation in the US as economic growth accelerates and wages appear to finally be rising after years of stagnation. US government bond yields, which rise as prices fall, hit the highest level since January 2014. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665 points to end the day down more than 2.5% and falling below 26,000, the record level it hit on 17 January. The sell-off came after the US labor department released a better than expected monthly jobs report, sparking fears of a sharper rise in interest rates. It was the first time since June 2016 that the Dow had fallen more than 500 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all from us for this week. Thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight! Bitcoin, incidentally, is still off its earlier lows. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 5% today at $8,556. The Dow finished 665.75 points lower. So it you round it down..... Each of the 30 companies on the Dow fell today. The worst performers were Chevron (-5.5%), Exxon (-5.1%) and Goldman Sachs (-4.5%). Tech stocks also had a bad day, with Apple down 4.3%. Over on the Nasdaq (which lost 2%), Alphabet slid by 5% after Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company missed expectations with its financial results last night. What caused the selloff? There are several factors, but the most significant may be today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report - showing wages rose by 2.9% over the last year. That increase in earnings could push up inflation, forcing US interest rates higher. It was a poor week for the S&amp;P 500 (a broader stock market index than the Dow) Traders on Wall Street will be nursing bruises; the Dow has lost 1,095 point this week. This looks like the third-biggest one-day points decline on the Dow ever! It also looks like the biggest points decline since the aftermath of Lehman Brothers collapse. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that historic. In percentage terms, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls are much less dramatic - but still a concern... NEWSFLASH: The US stock market has recorded its worst week in two years, after a wave of selling hit Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has tumbled by almost 670 points, or 2.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest percentage fall since June 2016, the day after the Brexit vote, and means the Dow has shed over 1,000 points this week. One important point - a 600-point plunge isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what it used to be, due to the strong market rally over the last 15 month. Wall Street is staggering towards the finishing line.... with five minutes to go, the Dow is down 675 points or 2,5%. Inflation fears, worries about the bond market, and rising political tensions are all hitting the markets today, according to CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest market report. Ken Odeluga, market analyst with City Index in London says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a smorgasbord of negativity...It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been pretty nervous all week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier today, president Trump approved the release of a memo alleging that the FBI had been biased against Trump over their investigations into possible Russian interference in the US elections. That move is weighing on investors, according to Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities. He warns: There looks like a breakdown of the institutions in our country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No matter what side you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Dow is now at a three-week low: Make that a 624-point fall...! Heading into the last hour of trading, the Dow is now down 576 points, or 2.2%. This could be the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst day since the aftermath of the Brexit vote.... The selloff is gathering speed! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down by 500 points, or almost 2%. Oil giant Exxon is still the biggest faller, down 5.5%, followed by Chevron (-4.1%) and Apple (-3.4%). Investors seem to be increasingly spooked by the prospect of US interest rate rises, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent US jobs report - which showed a pick-up in hiring and wages. Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, explains: A big wage growth number is the biggest risk to the stock market rally, because it means the Fed may get more aggressive in raising interest rates. Here are a few photos from Wall Street, as traders try to keep pace with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our colleague Richard Partington on the stock market losses today: Wall Street was heading for its worst week in two years on Friday as markets in Europe also continued to tumble from record-high levels reached less than a month ago. Investors headed for the exits amid growing fears over a bond market rout, triggered by early signs of inflation in the US as economic growth accelerates. US government bond yields, which rise as prices fall, hit the highest level since January 2014. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 400 points in early trading in New York, hitting a low of 25,787. Amid a widespread sell-off, the biggest fallers were Apple, Visa and oil firms Exxon and Chevron. In Europe, the FTSE 100 recorded its worst week since April last year when Theresa May called the snap election, dropping by 47 points to 7,443, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax fell 1.7%. The worst week for stocks under Donald Trump comes after one of the best years in history for shares in 2017 and just a week after the Dow hit a record high of 26,617. More here: With two and a half hours trading to go, Wall Street is solidly in the red. The Dow is down 1.5%, or almost 400 points, at 25,789 points. The wider S&amp;P 500 is off 1.1%, while the Nasdaq has lost almost 1%. Given the losses earlier this week, Marketwatch agrees that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on track for the worst weekly losses in two years. The markets in Mexico, Brazil and Canada are also having a bad day.... US wages may be growing, but so is inequality, says Dominic Rushe It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a long, slow recovery for US workers but wages finally appear to be growing again, according to the latest jobs report released on Friday. But behind the headline rate the figures show \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that inequality is on the rise. On Friday the labor department released its latest monthly jobs update. The US added 200,000 new positions in January, higher than expected, but the real surprise was in wage growth. Hourly earnings rose 0.3% in January, enough to lift the annual rate up to 2.9%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This may be the start of a welcome trend in wage gains, and marks the highest percentage increase in average hourly earnings since 2009,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said US secretary of labour Alexander Acosta. A tightening labour market and unemployment at 4.1% (a 17-year low) appears finally to be making its way into people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets as employers are forced to raise wages in order to attract talent. But the big numbers hide an ominous trend. For many Americans, slow wage growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a hangover of the post-2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great recession\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For those without a college degree the sluggish rate of growth can be traced back to the 1970s, and the more recent slump deepened that inequality. The full report is here: It was a bad day all round for global markets. The FTSE 100, as we mentioned earlier, has suffered its worst week since last April With poor results from Deutsche Bank to add to those of Daimler earlier this week, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has also dropped sharply, recording its biggest weekly fall since February 2016. And Wall Street continues to come under the cosh, as the better than expected jobs and confidence numbers add to the belief that interest rises are on the way. Investors have begun to take seriously the fact that central banks are removing the financial punchbowl which has powered markets for the past few years, and perhaps at a faster pace than had been expected. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 46.96 points or 0.63% to 7443.43 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.68% to 12,785.16 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.64% lower at 5364.98 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished down 1.44% at 23,202.66 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.81% lower at 10,211.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 358 points or 1.37%. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 384 points. The FTSE 100 has closed down 0.63% at 7443.43, as part of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global market sell 0ff. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is down 2.9%, making it the worst weekly performance since 21 April last year when it lost....2.91%. That incidentally was the week Theresa May decided to call a snap UK general election. Happy days. A quick summary of how bad it has been this week for US markets: Back with bitcoin, and it has been through the classic rollercoaster ride today. Having fallen as low as $7625 it is now actually in positive territory for the day, up 0.12% at $9010. More on the disparities in the US wage growth data: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US open made a miserable day all the worse for the European markets, while Bitcoin managed to pull back from the brink. Following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish hold from the Federal Reserve, there was arguably more interest in this non-farm Friday than there has been for a while. And, luckily for the ailing dollar, the numbers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint: the headline figure came in at 200k, far higher than both the 181k expected and the 160k posted in January, with wage growth also outperforming forecasts to remain unchanged at 0.3%. This, alongside a better than expected consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan, allowed the dollar to regain some ground lost this week. Against the pound the greenback rose 1%, sending cable back below $1.413, while against the euro the dollar jumped 0.7%, taking the currency away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.25-crossing 3 and a bit year peak. All this hawkishness was toxic for the Dow Jones, which plunged 300 points once the bell rang on Wall Street to hit 25900 for the first time in over a fortnight. This Dow drop only exacerbated the losses in Europe; the DAX and CAC both fell 1.3%, with the former on track for its worst close since September last year, while the FTSE slipped 0.7% to strike a sub-7450, near 8 week nadir. As for Bitcoin, while things are still bad, they are nowhere near as disastrous as they were at lunchtime. It had at one point found itself trading at $7750, a price not seen since the end of November, only for a wave of buyers to rescue it from those lows and send it back above $8650. Still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly been a week to forget for the cryptocurrency, with a hat-trick of bad news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a shift in regulations in South Korea, a Facebook ban on ads for the product, and an investigation by the US CFTC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c causing it to shed around $3000 per Bitcoin. With the dollar recovering in the expectation of an imminent US interest rate rise, the pound has lost some of its recent gains. Sterling is down more than 1% on the day against the dollar to $1.4119, its biggest daily fall since November last year. The university of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey may have come in better than expected but it did show the consumer sentiment index at its lowest level since September. However chief economist Richard Curtin was positive about the overall picture: Consumer sentiment has remained largely unchanged for more than a year at very favorable levels. The January Sentiment figure was just 0.2 Index-points below December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and just 1.1 points below the 2017 average of 96.8--which was the highest yearly average since 2000. Stock price increases and the passage of tax reforms were mentioned by all-time record numbers of consumers. To be sure, there were small offsetting declines among lower income households and residents of the Northeast. Consumers continued to expect growth in jobs and incomes, but anticipated a slightly higher inflation rate. Importantly, the motivating force behind purchase decisions has shifted from discounts on prices and interest rates to increased confidence in future job security and growth in wages as well as financial assets. This renewed sense of confidence was responsible for the recent declines in savings rates. he tax cuts will increase discretionary spending once higher energy bills due to the unusually cold weather are paid. Monetary policy will need to tighten in the year ahead, but given consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decade long experience with record low interest rates, only modest increases in interest rates will be sufficient to curb any excesses. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.8% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018. The upbeat consumer confidence figures have sent Wall Street even lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 300 points or more than 1.1%. More positive news for the US economy, adding to the belief that the Federal Reserve will be ready to raise interest rates next month. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 95.7 in January, up from an initial reading of 94.4 and better than the expected figure of 95. It was however slightly lower than December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final reading of 95.9. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, suggests the slump in bitcoin could be one of the reasons for the current weakness in global stock markets: Markets participants found themselves in the rare position of witnessing falling prices this week. It has naturally sparked questions of whether a larger correction is in store. The Dow Jones has pulled back 3% while the FTSE 100 has dropped nearly 4.5%. These are relatively small moves and based on recent experience, the mostly likely scenario is dip-buyers step in to send markets back up again. However, maybe this time will be different. The market has reached some new extremes in sentiment during January and certain risk-factors, notably the rise in bond yields, could point to further stock market declines. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conceivable that the Bitcoin bubble bursting has meant retail equity investors were meeting less margin calls. Rising bond yields have put stock markets on high alert. 2.6% was the first \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworry level\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in 10-year US treasuries. A 3% 10-year treasury yield is the big kahuna for a larger stock market correction. After many stops and starts in US interest rate rises, investors increasingly seem to be feeling like this tightening cycle could be here to stay. The phenomenon is global though. The UK gilt yield has hit its highest since May 2016. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yield hit a fresh 22-month high. Rising interest rates mean the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoldilocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario for markets is warming up to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdaddy bear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As expected US markets are in negative territory after the better than expected jobs figures gave a boost to the flagging dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 217 points or 0.8%, on track for its worst weekly performance since January 2016..The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.6% while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.55% lower. The rise in average earnings is not spread across the board: Here are the jobs data charts: Pantheon economist Ian Shepherdson reckons the jobs data should be good for shares. Wall Street futures have improved as we approach the opening of the US market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now forecast to open around 200 points lower, better than the 250 loss predicted in the immediate aftermath of the better than expected jobs figures. Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab expects US rate rises this year. And increased market volatility: The US economy started 2018 on a positive note as the labour market continues to tighten. This latest set of job numbers supports the view that that some of the weakness in December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service-providing industries would revert in January. Tightening labour market conditions and indications of a pickup in wage growth will be welcomed by the Fed which has expressed concern over benign inflation. While the Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday, we expect a hike in March as Jerome Powell is expected to continue down the familiar path of keeping inflation under control without raising rates so far or so fast as to stifle the improvement in growth expected this year. We continue to believe the Fed will hike rates at least three times this year and that, along with the paring of its balance sheet, historically-low financial conditions may start to tighten. However, with the outlook for inflation continuing to be carefully monitored, we do expect a higher level of volatility in the stock market this year relative to 2017. The big picture is that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been creating jobs each month since early into Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held steady under Donald Trump too. The upbeat US jobs figures makes it likely there will be an interest rate rise in March barring unforeseen circumstances, according to ING Bank. Economist James Knightley says: The US jobs report is very strong with payrolls rising 200,000 versus expectations of 180,000. There were some chunky upward revisions too, but the big story is wage growth which looks much, much better. Wages are now growing 2.9% year on year (the fastest rate of growth since 2009) with last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised up to 2.7% from 2.5%. Unemployment stays at 4.1%, but given the strength of this report it is hard to argue against a March Fed rate hike now. Wage growth has been the missing link in the strong economic growth, tight jobs market story. We have been hoping for some time to see a turnaround and it does finally look as though something is happening. It backs up evidence from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Federation of Independent Businesses small business survey, which showed the net proportion of businesses raising worker compensation is at its highest since 2000. The report also showed you have to go all the way back to 1989 to find when the index indicating the net proportion of businesses that plan to raise worker pay was higher. Given companies such as WalMart have credited Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts as a way for them to afford higher worker pay we suspect we will see the wage numbers pick-up further. Rising wages and robust economic growth is also supportive for our 3% headline CPI call for this summer. Consequently, it will need a big shock to prevent the Fed from hiking in March, but it could happen in the form of a damaging government shutdown should politicians fail to resolve their differences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next deadline is February 8. Nonetheless, it looks more and more likely that we will have to revise up our call for three Fed rate hikes this year to four. US firms are facing a real scramble to find staff to hire, reckons Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM. President Trump will probably enjoy today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While criticism of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embattled White House continues to mount, job growth continues to go through the gears, with the latest nonfarm payroll figures proving job creation remains a competence within the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capabilities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buoyant domestic and global demand, particularly for the manufacturing sector, appear the drivers in higher-than-anticipated numbers, and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal stimulus package is clearly a shot in the arm for economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, with the economy close to full employment, increased pressure on wages looks an inevitable consequence. So higher inflation is surely on the cards, with taller interest rates set to arrive over the coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A good jobs report = falling shares and bonds. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because traders suspect it means US interest rates will rise faster than expected, as inflation worries encourage central bankers to empty the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpunch bowl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of loose monetary policy. Financial experts like the look of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US labor market report. This is from Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX.com: Jeremy Cook of World First and Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Economics are both impressed by the wage growth: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeanna Smialek suggests that the Phillips curve may not be dead after all (the idea that inflation rises when unemployment falls). Economist Shaun Richards has spotted that bars and restaurants hired more staff last month: The dollar has climbed and US bond yields have risen following the better then expected jobs and wages figures. But the expected opening losses on Wall Street have increased according to the future market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open down around 250 points. Before the jobs data it was around 220 points lower. The dollar index has risen 0.3% to 88.95 while 10 year Treasury yields have hit a near four year high at 2.818%. And the price of 30 year bonds has fallen more than a point with yields at their highest level since March 2017. BREAKING: The US economy created 200,000 new jobs last month, a little more than Wall Street had expected. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure have been revised up too, to 160,000 new jobs (from 146,000). The US jobless rate remains at 4.1%, a 17-year low. Wages rose too, by 0.3% during the month and a healthy 2.9% year-on-year (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average hourly earnings) It looks like a pretty decent jobs report, at first glance. Well, this rather sums up the crypto bubble. Long Blockchain Corp -- formally known as Long Island Iced Tea -- has announced that it has abandoned plans to buy bitcoin mining equipment. Long Island rebranded itself as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblockchain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 company late last year, a move that caused its share price to quadruple. It is pressing on with its proposed merger with technology companyStater Blockchain Limited, but has ditched plans to buy \u00e2\u20ac\u01531,000 Antminer S9 mining rigs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to mine new bitcoins. More here.... Tension is building in the markets as investors brace for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report, due at 8.30am East Coast time (1.30pm in the UK). As usual, Wall Street experts have a range of predictions. The consensus is that 180,000 new jobs were created in January. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the wage growth figures that could move the markets; a (welcome) rise in earnings would make US interest rate rises more likely -- potentially bad news for bond prices and shares too. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide, and Nouriel Roubini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns:: Hold onto your hats. Bitcoin is clambering off the mat, and bouncing back to $8,500. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a 5% loss today, though... This is turning into a rather bad day for digital currencies. Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin et al are all suffering double-digit losses. Despite the recent plunge, bitcoin is still worth rather more than a year ago.... Bitcoin is being hit by two different issues (as explained earlier). Firstly, you have the growing threat of regulation, with India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister pledging yesterday to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceliminate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the use of digital currencies by criminals. That follows similar similar warnings from politicians in the UK, US and South Korea. Secondly, you have the investigation into Bitfinex (a leading digital currency exchange), and crypto firm tether. Regulators are questioning whether tether, whose coins are used to trade digital currency, are actually fully backed by US dollars as it claims. As Bloomberg explains: Tether\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coins have become a popular substitute for dollars on cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, with about $2.3 billion of the tokens outstanding as of Tuesday. While Tether has said all of its coins are backed by U.S. dollars held in reserve, the company has yet to provide conclusive evidence of its holdings to the public or have its accounts audited. Skeptics have questioned whether the money is really there. This double-dose of bad news is sparking a rout across the sector, sending bitcoin sliding through $8,000 (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $7,888 right now). Neil Wilson of ETX Capital reckons that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the wheels are coming off the bitcoin bandwagon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The regulatory crunch appears closer than ever and sooner or later this market could be headed back down to earth. Selling pressure at the moment is intense as there has been nothing but bad news for bitcoin bulls of late. The key concern facing the bulls is the CFTC investigation into Tether and the Bitfinex exchange. Claims of full dollar convertibility are under scrutiny. Given there are about 2bn tether coins in existence, there should be a $2bn account somewhere but Tether has yet to prove it or have accounts audited. The idea that Tether is creating coins to buy bitcoin is straight out of satire. If bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then this is Ponzi squared; printing fake money to buy a different type of fake money in order to ramp up the price of the latter. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to cause real world losses for many investors it would be hilarious. Meanwhile, we see the jaws of the regulatory crunch closing on other fronts with moves to ban or greatly restrict trading on bitcoin gaining traction worldwide. Ultimately if the CFTC decides bitcoin prices have been manipulated it casts a huge shadow of bitcoin and entire crypto market. At Davos last week, a series of experts cast doubt over bitcoin -- those predictions seem to be being born out today.... Ouch! Bitcoin has just tumbled through the $8,000 mark. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now trading at $7985 on the Bitstamp exchange, down over 11% this morning as volatile trading continues to rock the digital currency sector. This inflicts further losses on those who bought into bitcoin late last year. Bitcoin has now lost around 40% of its value this year (bitcoin started the New Year at $13,880), and 60% since its all-time peak in December. The US stock market is heading for another bath. The Dow Jones is being called down around 220 points, or 0.8%, amid nervousness ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll jobs report. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index is now down 1.1% - and facing its biggest weekly loss since the US presidential election in November 2016. In London, the FTSE 100 is extending its recent losses. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down another 28 points, or 0.3%, at 7461, its lowest level since 15 December. Investors are ignoring last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results from Amazon, in favour of fretting about the bond market again. Bond yields (which rise when prices fall) are climbing, on the back of concerns that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts will drive up US borrowing. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says trading is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rocky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe today. He points to the volatility in the bond market, where UK and German government debt has weakened: Gilt yields are at their highest since May 2015 and Bunds at their highest since September 2015. This may well be contributing to the declines we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen recently across Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with the corresponding appreciation of the euro and pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and could now be taking its toll on US stocks. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily mean we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve entered a risk-off period or that stocks are headed for a correction but a sharp rise in yields, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen, can also weigh on equity markets. The FT has a good take on the anxiety in the bond markets: The US is heading into some of its biggest budget deficits outside of wars and recessions as Congress debates increasing ceilings on federal spending on top of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trillion-dollar tax cuts. Lawmakers are contemplating lifting caps on defence and non-defence spending as they seek a funding deal in coming weeks. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a non-partisan think-tank, predicts that Congress will settle on plans that drive the deficit to 5.7 per cent of US gross domestic product in 2019 as annual borrowing exceeds $1.1tn. That would be well short of deficits as a share of GDP reached after the Great Recession or the second world war. But it would be comparable to the shortfall after the recession of the early 1980s under Ronald Reagan, even though the US is now at or beyond full employment and the global economy is in its strongest upswing in a decade.

Economics professor Nouriel Roubini has just been on Bloomberg TV, blasting bitcoin as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest Ponzi scheme in human history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Roubini claims that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charlatans and swindlers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drove digital currencies to record levels last year, before cashing their profits. Ordinary punters, who bought bitcoin when it was trading around $20,000, have lost 60% of their shirts since, says Roubini. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Davies on the job losses at Carillion: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good piece in the New Statesman today about the problems in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outsourcing sector, and the lessons to be learned. In it, Grace Blakeley argues that the demise of Carillion, and Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial problems, show that the outsourcing market is failing, and must change. Blakeley says: Firstly, rather than granting contracts to a small number of huge multinationals which then commission other, smaller specialist firms to do the work, the government should get rid of the middle man and deal with suppliers directly. This would boost small businesses, and tackle the uncompetitive nature of the current outsourcing market. It would also protect the government from another Carillion crisis. Secondly, public contracts should not be awarded solely on the basis of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value for money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Government contracts should be seen as an opportunity to create public value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where value is understood in holistic rather than narrow economistic terms. The government should account for the wider economic and social impact of its suppliers when determining which supplier should be awarded a particular contract. The Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals to account for the quantity and quality of employment created by a supplier, the nature of its corporate governance, its environmental impact and its attitude towards tax suggests how this could be done. Thirdly, we need to call time on private financing. If the government wants to build a major infrastructure project it should do so through historically cheap public borrowing, on the public balance sheet, justifying the investment based on the economic, social, or environmental impact. Good public investment done well more than pays for itself in the long run. It should also expand its definition of investment to include investment in human as well as physical capital \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spending on healthcare and education is just as much of an investment in the long-run economic capacity of this country as investments in roads and bridges. More here: The problem with outsourcing is not Carillion but the market itself NEWSFLASH: Nearly 400 Carillion staff have just been made redundant, following its fall into liquidation last month. The Official Receiver says it has managed to save more than 900 jobs, but 377 more have lost their jobs. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now being told to contact the JobCentre. The employees whose jobs have been saved work on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infrastructure, central and local government, and construction contracts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They are now being transferred to new employees who have taken on these contracts. Carillion employed almost 20,000 staff in the UK, so thousands more Carillion workers still face an uncertain future. A spokesperson for the Official Receiver says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As part of the ongoing liquidation of the Carillion group I am pleased we have been able to safeguard the jobs of 919 employees today. Most staff are transferring on existing or similar terms and I will continue to facilitate this wherever possible as we work to find new providers for Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other contracts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite best efforts it has not been possible to secure the jobs of 377 staff, who will be made redundant. Those affected will be entitled to make a claim for statutory redundancy payments. The Jobcentre Plus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Rapid Response Service stands ready to support any of these employees by providing advice and information so people can move into a new job as quickly as possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I recognise that this will be a worrying time for all those affected, their families and local communities. I would like to thank all staff for their professionalism throughout the liquidation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am expecting many employees working on other Carillion contracts to transfer in the coming weeks and we are continuing to keep the workforce updated as these are arrangements are finalised.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, fears that we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the full impact of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse yet. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply says political and economic uncertainty is hitting the UK construction sector, pushing it towards stagnation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The blocks to progress included a sharp rise in costs and a shortage of key materials, which contributed to longer lead times as supplier capabilities were stretched to their limits. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against this challenging backdrop, though larger orders from cautious clients also failed to materialise, firms retained a sunny disposition with optimism at a seven-month high and a slight rise in employment continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With construction teetering on the edge of contraction, this surprise outcome will serve as a jolt to policymakers, that the impact of political and economic uncertainty remains large at the beginning of 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sam Teague, Economist at IHS Markit, says there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much New Year cheer in the building sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI data indicated a difficult start to 2018 for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector, underlined by business activity growth slumping to a four-month low and new orders sliding back into decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A contraction in house building added to lacklustre commercial building and civil engineering markets, and reduced inflows of new work suggest overall activity could slip into decline in February. Furthermore, cost pressures remained intense, fuelled by shortages of input materials and high costs for imported products. Max Jones, global corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says the collapse of Carillion has hit the construction sector. Jones explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has clearly been a month like no other for the sector, so this drop in the PMI reading comes as no major surprise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation has rippled down the supply chain and shaken confidence across the industry. There have inevitably been fears for the sub-contractors with exposure to the collapse, though some have drawn down on emergency support from banks, including the \u00c2\u00a350m Lloyds fund. Tens of thousands of small construction companies, and other suppliers, across the UK were hit by Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock liquidation in early January. Work was halted at two major hospitals, while other firms were forced to lay off staff as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to be paid for work carried out for Carillion. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry has slowed to near stagnation, and housebuilding is in decline. Data firm Markit reports that UK building companies experienced a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subdued start to 2018\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with total industry activity barely rising. Its monthly construction PMI, which measures activity, dropped to just 50.2 for January from 52.2 in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worryingly closed to the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. In another blow, housebuilding activity shrank - while civil engineering work picked up. Job creation across the construction industry also slowed, to an 18-month low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fresh hit to apprentices already reeling from the collapse of Carillion last month. Markit says: A return to contraction in residential building activity was accompanied by near-stagnant commercial and civil engineering activity. New orders declined, linked by many companies to market uncertainty. On a more positive note, confidence towards future growth prospects improved, with many firms anticipating an increase in new project wins later in the year. More to follow... This is turning into bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst week since 2013.... Of course, bitcoin has always bounced back from its previous slumps (five years ago it was worth just $20). But is this time different?.... Telecoms group BT is also having a bad morning. Shares have fallen over 5% to 241.3p, a five-year low, after some underwhelming results this morning. Profits over the last nine months are down 9%, and the company has also reported a fall in TV customers - despite splashing out on live Ashes coverage (given England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, perhaps they should have spared us....) My colleague Mark Sweney points out that BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer division seems to be slowing, while its IT services division continues to struggle.... At the risk of labouring the point..... Economics professor Nouriel Roubini says the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmother of all bubbles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is now deflating fast: European stock markets are on the back foot again this morning, with losses across the board. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is the worst performer. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being dragged down by Deutsche Bank, which has lost almost 6% after reporting a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac497m loss for 2017 (alongside that $70m fine) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Naeem Aslam of Think Markets on bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline: Bitcoin below 10K tells you only one message which is the upward momentum has died out and the odds are that we would continue to consolidate or grind lower. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx agrees that bitcoin is firmly on the back foot. The biggest story this Friday didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong to the traditional markets, however, but Bitcoin. Opening Monday at $11700 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remember at its 2017 it hit $20000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is now struggling to keep its head above $8400, following a week that dealt blow after blow to the cryptocurrency. First there was the introduction of new regulations on anonymous trading accounts in South Korea, one of Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest markets, followed by reports that Facebook would be banning cryptocurrency adverts on its site. Now comes the news that Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pre-Christmas rise is being investigated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for market manipulation, closing out a horrible few days for the previously ascendant product. Deutsche Bank has been fined $70m (\u00c2\u00a349m) by US regulators for attempting to rig a benchmark for interest-rate derivatives and other financial instruments. The bank agreed the settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after investigators found traders sought to manipulate rates from 2007 until May 2012. It is alleged the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff knew they were breaking the law, with one trader telling a broker that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot of people would actually do jail time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if practices were exposed. James McDonald, the CFTC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of enforcement, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no room in our markets for manipulation. We will continue to work hard to stamp it out, wherever we find it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank said it had co-operated with the investigation and had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undertaken significant efforts to remediate benchmark-related activities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reckons bitcoin is following a familiar pattern: Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at Centtrip, says Bitcoin has made a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153woeful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd start to the new year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The drop followed comments made by India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Minister of Finance, Arun Jaitley, that the Indian government \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoes not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We anticipate there will be more of such protectionist regulation. This is likely to put Bitcoin under more strain, causing it to drop to the $8000 a coin level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd January was a cruel month for digital currency fans, and February isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turning out much better. Bitcoin has fallen by 5% this morning to $8,521, its lowest level since late November. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost more than half its value since peaking near $20,000 in the week before Christmas. The selloff follows reports that American regulators are investigating whether last autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price surge had been caused by market manipulation. According to Bloomberg, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been investigating the Bitfinex exchange and a cryptocurrency company called Tether. Fortune Magazine has a good explanation: Specifically, regulators are curious about Bitfinex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with virtual currency Tether, which the exchange claims is pegged to the dollar. So in theory, one dollar equals one Tether. Tether has become a popular way for some investors to buy Bitcoin on exchanges. But the CFTC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probe feeds into worries that Tether may not be actually backed by the dollar, as Bitfinex has provided little proof of the relationship, critics say. That hazy relationship has fueled concerns that Bitfinex may be simply creating Tether coins out of thin air and using Tether to buy Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthereby propping up the price of the latter asset. Digital currencies have also been hit by the news that Facebook is banning all adverts for cryptocurrencies. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister added to their woes, by saying his country doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept cryptocurrencies as legal tender and pledging to fight their use for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegitimate activities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is faring, when January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll is released. Economists predict that around 180,000 new jobs were created last month, up from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing 148,000 (which might get revised today). That should leave the jobless rate at just 4.1%, which is a 17-year low, although it could possibly drop to just 4.0%. If so, expect some gleeful tweeting from President Trump...... The key issue, though, is whether wage growth picked up. It could rise to 2.6% from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.5%, which could fuel expectations of higher inflation in America. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says: The tightening labour market is yet to put much upward pressure on wage growth, but with core inflation now starting to rebound we suspect that average hourly earnings will not be far behind. Signs of inflationary pressures have already been hitting the bond market in recent days, sending prices down and yields to their highest level in several years. So we could see more action there today. Meanwhile in the UK, we get a new health check on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Construction PMI report is expected to show that growth slowed a little in January. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also got financial results from BT and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deutsche Bank (more shortly....) European stock markets are expected to open a little lower, led by Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda. 9.30am GMT: UK Construction PMI for January 1.30pm GMT: US non-farm payroll jobs report 3pm GMT: University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of US consumer sentiment",

                "bodyText":"US stocks took a further steep plunge on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1,175 points, the largest one-day points fall on record and erasing all the gains made so far this year. The drop came after another bad day on global markets as investors reacted to global equity losses overnight and concern that central banks will increase interest rates in response to inflationary pressures from surging global economies. The Dow dropped 1,600 points in one instance before bouncing back. The index is now off more than 1,800 points over two days of trading. Global stock markets have shown little volatility over the last few years amid a period of unprecedented low interest rates that followed in the wake of the great recession. But on the day that new Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, took office, replacing Janet Yellen, that quiet period seemed to be over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was volatility unleashed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at at Cresset Wealth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partially fear of interest rates, partially this new Fed chairman Jerome Powell, partially the market is overvalued relative to fundamentals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While market fear may not be based in any change in economic fundamentals, in its last meeting under chair Yellen, the Federal Reserve indicated it expects inflation pressures to increase through the year. According to projections released in December, officials expect three rate hikes in 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so long as market conditions remain broadly as they are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but some economists believe the central bank could add another increase at its final meeting of the year. If the market falls continue they could prove problematic for Donald Trump who has consistently touted record high stock markets as proof that his presidency is boosting the economy. US stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February. However, the White House, responding to the market drop insisted on Monday night that long-term economic fundamentals \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain exceptionally strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The plunge, initially triggered by fears that strong US employment numbers would lead to wage demands and rising inflation, represents the first two-day drop of 1,000 points or greater for the Dow since August 2015. The sell-off was reflected on other US indexes, with the S&amp;P 500 also recording its steepest drop since 2015 and erasing its gains for the year. The sell-off represents a stark turnaround in market sentiments, said Ablin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the middle of last month, optimism, bullishness and complacency was at an all-time high. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly fearful now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ablin. In London, shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 100 publicly listed companies on Monday suffered their worst single-day slump since Theresa May called the snap election last April. The index of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 100 companies stretched its longest losing streak since last November into a fifth day, following a 1.3% fall. The FTSE 100 index tumbled to 7,345, having peaked at almost 7,800 last month. Hussein Sayed, the chief market strategist at currency dealer FXTM, said investors were nervous about the prospect of higher interest rates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The era of cheap money is ending, and for markets who got addicted to it, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s undoubtedly bad news,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The Fed is expected to react to survey data published last week showing that average US wage growth hit 2.9% in January and could go above 3% in the next few months. Wage increases are one of the main components pushing up prices in US shops. Stock markets remain high globally and the economies of most of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest countries are robust. But fears about the pace of rate increases and the size of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ballooning deficit have worried some investors. Last week, a member of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main interest-rate setting committee, Robert Kaplan, suggested that rates could increase by more than 0.75 percentage points this year if the economy maintains its fast rate of growth and wages continue to rise strongly. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You will see some inflation pressure this year. I believe that the Fed should be removing accommodation gradually but deliberately.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Haefele, the global chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS, said the bond market, which trades in government and corporate debt, remained steady despite recent declines in values that increased the likelihood of defaults. He said stock market investors should sit tight while bond yields, which measure the risk attached to each bond, remained modest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that now is a time to reduce exposure to stocks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets have been addicted to low interest rates and global central banks pumping money into the financial system. As economies around the world are improving, this means higher interest rates and less stimulus from central banks. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why investors are throwing a hissy-fit. Not because anything is wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Far eastern markets fell overnight by the most in over a year, with the Nikkei among the worst affected following a 2.5% drop to 22,682. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil slid to $67.30 from above $70 in the middle of last month. The FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall was limited by worse than expected economic data that sent the pound down to $1.40 from $1.42 overnight. Car registrations in the UK slumped by 6% in January and the Markit/CIPS survey of the services sector recorded its worst level of growth for 16 months. Many of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest businesses earn the majority of their income in dollars and any increase in the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value versus the pound increases their profits.

From current activity, it looks like calm has returned, with steady dip buying been seen on both sides of the Atlantic. It will take more than a few days of chaos to disrupt this bull market.

A stellar ISM services PMI likely helped, with the figure coming in far higher than forecast at 59.9, against the 56.5 expected and the 55.9 seen in December. </p> <p>The dollar, meanwhile, got revenge on the pound for its last few months of misery. Cable dropped 0.9%, informed not only by the new wave of hawkishness to hit the markets and that strong ISM non-manufacturing PMI, but the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own 17 month low-striking services reading and the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest round of Brexit in-fighting. Sterling also struggled against the euro, falling 0.6% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.128, its worst price against the single currency in 2 and a half weeks. </p> <p>Unusually the FTSE could find no joy in the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. The UK index was too busy dealing with the market-wide fear that a further rise in interest rates is on its way, sliding 1.1% as the day went on. The Eurozone indices, meanwhile, were a mixed bag. The DAX managed to reduce its losses to just 0.4%, following the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, but with the French CAC and Spanish IBEX down 1.1% and 1.2% respectively.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7877c0e4b0c56a1f8b6ffc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-05T15:35:04.971Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street recovers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Quite some turnaround on US markets.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down less than 100 points and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are in positive territory, helped by a rebound in technology stocks.

However, the pullback is likely to be just an overdue correction (with say a 10% or so fall) rather than a severe bear market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c providing the rise in bond yields is not too abrupt and recession is not imminent in the US with profits continuing to rise.

Federal MPs from both sides of the political divide have urged Australian investors not to panic after the share market suffered a A$50bn-plus sell-off, AAP reports: Australian shares shed over 200 points or over 3.5% by late trading on Tuesday, more than doubling the sell-off of the previous day. Treasurer Scott Morrison believed the big dive on the US stock market was a recalibration associated with recent economic data. He told reporters in Canberra the market was reacting to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US wage data and more bullish sentiment about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening with inflation and its impact on bond markets: Markets are volatile. When they recalibrate in relation to events like this, you do see a bit of these events happening. But people who watch these markets more and participate in them more closely than I do, I think, will see this for what it is and understand the forces behind it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said self-funded retirees who relied on their share portfolios would obviously be concerned, but people understood that share markets go up and down: That is the nature of the stock market. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure people are keeping a close eye on it but I do think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to keep it in that context.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Share market volatility aside, Trade Minister Steven Ciobo said the Australian economy was behaving \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exceptionally strongly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: We are seeking really strong economic growth in Australia. We are seeing great employment creation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, following the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first board meeting of the year, said he expected economic growth to pick up to above three per cent over the next couple of years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a pace not seen consistently for a number of years. Spot the difference: The FTSE is set to open a huge 4.7% down according to online trading company IG. Thats big in anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s books. That decline is the Nikkei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest point drop since November 1990, Reuters has pointed out. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s afternoon trading session is not looking pretty: losses are now hovering around 7%. A few moments ago the Nikkei 225 index was 21,078.71 points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a tumble of more than 1600 points since yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an hour left before close of trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, at which point we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a better sense of the historical context of the falls. Maki Sawada, from the investment research and investor services department at Nomura Securities Co, said stocks were being sold in panic after the Wall Street losses. She told Kyodo News: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sell-off accelerated in a chain reaction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, bitcoin has dipped below US$6,200 for the first time in three months. Six weeks after its record high of $19,511, bitcoin dropped to $6,190, with warnings it could plummet further. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader, told AFP: The risk-off tone is hitting Bitcoin almost as hard as a global regulator and bank scrutiny. The latest dent to the Cryptospace has been banks saying they are shutting down the ability of clients to buy bitcoin with their cards. This could end up a full round trip back into the $1,850/$2,966 region. Consumer spending remains a concern for the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has again left the cash rate on hold at 1.5%. At its first meeting of 2018 on Tuesday, the RBA board decided to leave the cash rate at the record low level it has now held for 18 months. Governor Philip Lowe said business conditions were positive and increased public infrastructure spending was supporting the economy, but the outlook for household consumption remains uncertain. Read the full report: Associated Press reports: Shares tumbled in Asia on Tuesday after a wild day for US markets that resulted in the biggest drop in the Dow Jones industrial average in six and a half years. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 index skidded 6.1% percent to 21,296.03 by early Tuesday afternoon. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index lost 4.9% to 30,651.31 and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark S&amp;P ASX 200 had skidded 3.3% to 5,828.40. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kospi declined 2.9% to 2,418.70 and the Shanghai Composite index was off 2.2% at 3,412.55. All other regional markets were lower. The losses in Asia tracked the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,175 point plunge on Monday, its worst point drop of all time and its worst percentage decline since August 2011. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There would be few places to hide from the risk-off atmosphere that is expected to extend its stay in Asian markets today in a significant manner,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is fear rolling over itself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Panic in other markets can send investors racing for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe haven\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Japanese yen holdings, she noted. That is painful for Japanese and other regional export manufacturers, whose competitiveness is hurt by stronger currencies that push their prices relatively higher. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen early Tuesday, trading at 108.61 yen, down from 109.12 on Monday. Australian shares shed four months of gains in just morning trading, with all sectors losing ground. With afternoon trading under way in Japan, the losses on the benchmark Nikkei 225 index have now passed 6%. A few moments ago the index was at 21,243.15 points, a decline of 1438.93 points (6.34%) since yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AAP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on that RBA decision: The Reserve Bank of Australia has left the cash rate unchanged at 1.5%, citing continuing concerns about weak household consumption. Following its first meeting of 2018, the RBA board left its official interest rate at the record low level it has now held for 16 months. The central bank said in a statement accompanying the February decision that while business conditions and investment were improving, household consumption remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a continuing source of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Australian dollar, already losing ground after worse than expected retail and international trade data, fell following the RBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision and was at 78.61 US cents at 1437 AEDT, from 78.73 US cents ahead of the announcement. The statement from the RBA explains: The low level of interest rates is continuing to support the Australian economy. Further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual. Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. The cash rate will remain unchanged at 1.5%, according to a statement from the RBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, Philip Lowe. Markets in Japan have taken a hit in morning trade after the steep plunge in the US Dow Jones industrial average in the United States. By the close of morning trade on Tuesday, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark Nikkei 225 index had fallen 5.26% to 21,487.87 points, its lowest level since October. It had fallen by as much as 5.64% about 11am local time before recovering slightly. Trading will soon resume for the afternoon session. If the Nikkei 225 finishes the day around the same level, according to a Kyodo News report: It would be the largest single-day drop since it plunged over 1,286 points in June 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hiroshige Seko, the economy minister, vowed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closely monitor the market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But in an attempt to ease the local jitters, he said: Corporate profits are at record-high levels, and the Japanese economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trend is nothing to be pessimistic about.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kyodo News interviewed a tax accountant, 49, who, while watching a stock price display in Tokyo, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be singing from the same song sheet as the minister: It reminds me of what happened at the time of the Lehman shock. I hope prices will stop falling soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TOPIX, a broader index that accounts for all first-section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, declined 4.99% in morning trade. According to a TOPIX breakdown, the biggest losses were in the glass and ceramics sector (down 7.13%), nonferrous metals (down 6.54%), insurance (down 6.45%), and metal products (down 6.35%). The mid-session report from CommSec warns this is the worst day for Australian equities in almost two years: The Australian market is slumping by almost 3% at lunch; the worst day for local equities in 20 months following a massive tumble for US shares overnight, which takes the ASX 200 to a three-and-a-half month low \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Locally, all sectors are coming under substantial pressure with all stocks on the ASX 200 index (with the exception of gold stocks) slumping. Energy stocks are the worst performers, dropping by 4%, with Woodside (WPL) and Santos (STO) leading the falls. Tech stocks, retailers and healthcare are down by ~3%. CommSec expects the RBA to keep interest rates at their current level; the announcement is expected within the next half an hour: The Reserve Bank (RBA) will almost certainly keep rates on hold this afternoon at 2.30pm AEDT. Economists will be paying close attention to the accompanying one-page statement by the central bank and comments about the Aussie dollar and wages growth. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms is down by 5.15%: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how things stood globally at 2am GMT: Tokyo Nikkei 225: DOWN 5.1% at 21,529.19 Hong Kong Hang Seng: DOWN 3.2% at 31,225.11 Shanghai Composite: DOWN 2.1% at 3,415.86 Euro/dollar DOWN at $1.2384 from $1.2373 at 2200 GMT Pound/dollar DOWN at $1.3972 from $1.3958 Dollar/yen DOWN at 109.08 yen from 109.13 yen Oil West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 56 cents at $63.59 per barrel Oil Brent North Sea: DOWN 58 cents at $67.04 per barrel New York DOW: DOWN 4.6% at 24,345.75 (close) New York S&amp;P 500: DOWN 4.1% at 2,648.94 (close) London FTSE 100: DOWN 1.5% at 7,334.98 (close) US S&amp;P 500 futures, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most liquid, tumbled 2.5% to four-month lows in Asian trade on Tuesday as the sell-off triggered by worries about inflation showed no sign of abating, Reuters reports. They fell to as low as 2,542, the weakest levels since early October, and 11.7% below their record peak of 2,878.5 touched on 29 January. David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares Capital, tells us: The first thing is that the market was severely overbought coming into February, so the markets were looking for an excuse to sell off. The payrolls number on Friday provided a powerful reason to do so. What was a surprise was the speed of the selloff on Friday and Monday. It was pretty sizeable. But I still think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a correction than an end of the bull market, although the Dow Jones is off quite a bit already. The key thing is the US wages number. The markets will be nervous waiting for the next payroll at the start of next month. If it goes up, get very worried. But in the last few years every time wages have spiked they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve fallen back again. Amid the global market jitters, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 index has now lost more than 5% in morning trading. At last check it has fallen 1,201.61 points to 21,480.47 points (-5.3%). China and Hong Kong stocks have taken a tumble on opening. There was a drop of 2% for both the CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index, while the Hang Seng saw a 3.8% dip. Neatly encapsulated by Bloomberg here: And here we go: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets are the next to open: Paul Dales, chief Australia and New Zealand economist at Capital Economics, tells us: The selloff seems due to reconsideration by the markets of how rapidly rates might rise this year. And that seems to have been triggered by data figures showing a rise in US wage growth on Friday. The most important question is will it continue? We expected wage increases to pick in the US and for the Fed to pick up the number of rate rises this year. So on that basis it will be sustained. That said, we feel the equities market will be underpinned by reasonably strong growth this year in the world economy. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see equities fall sharply. They might finish the year lower than they started but they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall sharply because of the expected growth in the global economy. In the midst of a very turbulent day, Guardian Australia cartoonist First Dog on the Moon has this helpful offering: the last thing you ever need to read about blockchain. Probably. Australia has slipped to a trade deficit of A$1.36bn (US$1bn) in December, from a revised A$36m surplus in November, AAP reports. Exports were up 2% for the month while imports were 6% higher, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. The Australian dollar has fallen from 78.85 US cents ahead of the data release to 78.67 US cents. The latest from Tokyo: The Nikkei 225 index is continuing to dive deeper. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now lost nearly 1,100 points in early trade. The latest figures (at 9.45am Tokyo time) show a drop of 4.83% to 21,586.31 points. Masahiro Ichikawa, a senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co, told the Kyodo news agency: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the Nikkei will face resistance at 21,500.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ichikawa added that investors would also keep an eye on the yen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movement against the US dollar. The market would be further weighed down if the US dollar dropped below the 109 yen line, Ichikawa told Kyodo. Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, has thoughts on the Australian market response ahead of the announcement by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) at 2.30 pm AEDT (3.30am GMT): The local stock market will open sharply lower this morning but could outperform US markets if the current sell-off extends over coming weeks. At 15.9, the blended forward PE on the ASX 200 is above the 2013-17 average of 15.2. However, at 2.83% the 10-year bond yield is still below the 3.05% average that applied during that period. The upcoming profit-reporting season could also help the local market fall less than the US if the current sell-off extends. Oil fell last night while base metals were slightly firmer. This indicates that pressure on oil markets is largely about concerns over increasing shale oil supply rather than a general risk off move in commodities. The Aussie dollar, on the other hand has been a risk off casualty, falling heavily against major currencies. The market impact of major data releases today including retail sales, balance of trade and the RBA statement could be important in that context. Markets would be encouraged if retail sales data can provide further comfort that consumption has continued to recover from its late winter/early spring funk. After half an hour of trading in Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index has dropped 4.28% to 21,710.20. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fall of 971.88 points. And it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen the bottom yet. Mining stocks are down 4.45%, oil and coal down 4.58%, and insurance stocks are down 5.44%, according to a breakdown of sectors in Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TOPIX index. Associated Press has some useful context for the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest ever points drop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge was the biggest ever in terms of points, but on a percentage basis, it was only its 100th worst single day drop, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. It had a larger percentage drop as recently as August 2011. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steepest percentage decline was on Black Monday on 19 October 1987, when it fell 22.6%. The 10 largest point declines 5 February 2018: Close 24,345.75 Decline in points -1,175.21 Decline in % -4.6 29 September 2008: Close 10,365.45 Decline in points -777.68 Decline in % -7 15 October 2008: Close 8,577.91 Decline in points -733.08 Decline in % -7.9 17 September 2001: Close 8,920.70 Decline in points -684.81 Decline in % -7.1 1 December 2008: Close 8,149.09 Decline in points -679.95 Decline in % -7.7 9 October 2008: Close 8,579.19 Decline in points -678.92 Decline in % -7.3 2 February 2018: Close 25,520.96 Decline in points -665.75 Decline in % -2.5 8 August 2011: Close 10,809.85 Decline in points -634.76 Decline in % -5.6 14 April 2000: Close 10,305.78 Decline in points -617.78 Decline in % -5.7 24 June 2016: Close 17,400.75 Decline in points -610.32 Decline in % -3.4 Back in Australia, the market lost A$52bn (US$41bn/\u00c2\u00a329bn) in its first four minutes of trading this morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop of 2.7%. Monday had already seen a loss of A$30bn. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei share average has fallen to its lowest level since late October 2017, Reuters confirms. My colleague Daniel Hurst reports from Tokyo: The Nikkei Index 400 is down 3.81% in early trade in Japan, while the Nikkei mid and small cap index has plunged 4.41%. Stock markets in Japan and South Korea have just opened with an immediate drop, as expected. Within minutes, the Nikkei 225 index was down by more than 3.3%. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog while Graeme Wearden grabs some sleep. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be sticking with the Asian and Australian markets news right here. Bloomberg have calculated that Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street rout wiped $1.25 trillion off the US stock market. That wipes out all the gains recorded in early 2018, when Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts sparked a rally. The Australian stock market has tumbled on opening and investors are bracing for more big losses on Tuesday in the wake of a chaotic day of trading on Wall Street. The ASX was down 2.71% or 163 points early Tuesday, the worst fall, so far, since June 2016. Before the market opened futures were down 139 points, and the Australian dollar slipped below the US79\u00c2\u00a2 mark. It comes in the wake of a wild day on Wall Street in which the Dow ended up down 1,175 points, a slump of 4.6% - which is the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst day in more than six years - and a day after Australian markets fell 1.55%. CommSec chief executive Craig James said the market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153correction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had further to go. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to remember these US markets were at all time highs, record highs, he said, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an orderly correction [to] more normal levels, fairer markets. The concern is that the US economy is doing too well and that could mean higher interest rates. Share markets have gone too far and need to correct to normal levels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier the Treasurer Scott Morrison tried to calm nerves about the fall, describing it as a recalibration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets are volatile - when they recalibrate in relation to events like this you do see a bit of these events happening,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But people who watch these markets more and participate in them more closely than I do, I think, will see this for what it is and understand the forces behind it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last Friday, the latest US jobs report sparked worries over the prospects for inflation and a surge in bond yields, as well as concerns the Federal Reserve will raise rates at a faster pace than expected. Newsflash: Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen by 2.7% at the start of trading. The reverberations from Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide are rippling through global markets. More to follow... CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matthew Taylor warns of a rough start to trading in Australia... Stock market traders in Japan should prepare for a very turbulent day.... Markets in Asia are set to open lower on Tuesday, with Nikkei futures down more than 3% after the U.S. stock market rout, says Marketwatch. Some experts are blaming computerised trading systems for fuelling today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Certainly, there was something unnerving about the way the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted to a 1,500 point loss in the final hour of trading, shedding 700 points in just six minutes. Could algorithmic trading strategies have caused it, by firing out fresh sell orders every time the Dow slipped lower? Steve Wachtel, portfolio manager of SSI Investment Management, told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[It was a] Sharper sell-off than we expected but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technical based with mostly the machines selling. Seemed like there was a minor flash crash there around noon. We look at the credit markets closely when there is a large equity sell-off and the credit markets are still very healthy, just moderate spread widening today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA also blames computer-based trading. A brief flash crash on Monday afternoon saw the Dow shed more than 1,500 points, a large chunk of which occurred in a very short period of time. Naturally there is a lot of questions being asked about the role of automated trading in the collapse and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the discussion will happen over the coming days but the important thing is that markets recovered from the initial shock. Here are a few photos from Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brutal and dramatic day: Although the Dow gets a lot of attention (especially when it plunges over 1,000 points), we should remember it only contains 30 companies. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re mostly big household names - like Boeing (-5.7% today), Pfizer (-5.3%), Coca-Cola (-3.9%), Intel (-3.5%) and Apple (the best performer, down only 2.5%). The S&amp;P 500 is a broader measure. And it also had a rough day, down over 4% in its biggest selloff since August 2011. Reuters has more details: The benchmark S&amp;P 500 and the Dow suffered their biggest percentage drops since August 2011 as a long-awaited pullback from record highs deepened. The financial, healthcare and industrial sectors fell the most, but declines were spread broadly as all major 11 S&amp;P groups dropped at least 1.7 percent. All 30 of the blue-chip Dow industrial components finished negative. With Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines, the S&amp;P 500 erased its gains for 2018 and is now down 0.9 percent in 2018. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the US, Canada, Mexico and Brazilian stock markets ended on Monday evening: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleagues Philip Inman and Ed Helmore on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama: US stocks took a further steep plunge on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1,179 points, the largest one-day points fall on record and erasing all the gains made so far this year. The drop came after another bad day on global markets as investors reacted to global equity losses overnight and concern that central banks will increase interest rates in response to inflationary pressures from surging global economies. The Dow dropped 1,600 points in one instance before bouncing back. The index is now off more than 1,800 points over two days of trading. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was volatility unleashed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at at Cresset Wealth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partially fear of interest rates, partially this new Fed chairman Jerome Powell, partially the market is overvalued relative to fundamentals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If the falls continue they could prove problematic for president Donald Trump who has consistently touted record high stock markets as proof that his presidency is boosting the economy. A new job is always a learning curve. But spare a thought for Jerome Powell, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new top central banker. Powell formally took over from Janet Yellen as head of the Federal Reserve today, and straight into a day of market mayhem. One factor driving the sell-off, it seems, is concern that the Fed may be more hawkish than expected under Powell - and raise interest rates aggressively. The latest US jobs data, released last Friday, showed a big jump in wage growth - which could push inflation higher. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 began the week by shedding 108 points or 1.5% to a two-month low of 7334 points. City firm IG is currently predicting that it could fall by over 250 points when trading resumes on Tuesday. I must repeat that these futures markets can change significantly overnight - but it shows that Tuesday could be another dramatic day in the markets.... Naeem Aslam of Think Markets predicts further losses in the days ahead, given the ferocity of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off. By looking at the market reaction today, one thing is for certain that we are in for a rough ride and Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame this one on Obama. I have a strong feeling that this sell off is going to intensify because bears are seeing blood on the street. Asia-Pacific markets are likely to suffer fresh losses when they open for Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sessions. The news that Wall Street has suffered its worst day in six years will surely spook investors. The Japanese Nikkei is currently being called sharply lower - but that could change by the time trading begins in a couple of hours. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the market rout: U.S. stocks plunged the most in 6 1/2 years, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1,100 points, as the equity selloff reached a fever pitch amid rising concern that inflation will force interest rates higher. Treasuries rallied and gold rose on haven demand. Volatility roared back into American equity markets, as the S&amp;P 500 Index sank 4.1 percent to wipe out its January gain and turn lower on the year. The index capped its worst day since the U.S. lost its pristine credit rating, topping the rout that followed China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock devaluation of the yuan, the Brexit selloff and jitters heading into the presidential election. Trading volume was almost double the 30-day average. All but two stocks in the broad gauge declined. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is classic risk off that may not end any time soon,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Win Thin, head of emerging-market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. Financial blogger Josh Brown has put today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout into historical context... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off is truly historic, in one sense. The Dow has never, ever, suffered a 1,500 plunge during a single trading session before. And it has never before posted a quadruple-digit fall on a single day. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wild selloff has firmly beaten the previous biggest points fall, of 777 points - set during the 2008 financial crisis. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too carried away, though; in percentage terms, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff is less dramatic - but still the worst in six years. The Washington Post sums up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wild trading thus: The Dow Jones industrial average plunged a heart-stopping 1,500 points in afternoon trading on Monday before gaining back some ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and finishing at 24,342, or down 4.6 percent \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as volatility returned to the stock market with a vengeance after a year of rare tranquility. The Dow has swung more than 2,100 points in the last two sessions, a decline pushing more than 8 percent and shattering long-term momentum. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has suffered its worst day in over six years. After a wild trading session, the Dow has ended down 1,175 points at 24,345 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slump of 4.6% - which is the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst day in over six years. There were also heavy losses on the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices, which both lost around 4% (updated). Investors in Australia are bracing for another volatile day when their markets open in a few hours. The futures market suggests there could be some sharp losses. The benchmark Australian index, the S&amp;P/ASX200, is being called down 88 points, or almost 1.5% That follows Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, as Australian Associated Press explains: The Australian market on Monday lost around $33 billion after a sharp fall in US markets last Friday sent local investors running for the exits. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index fell 95.2 points, or 1.56 per cent, to 6,026.2 points while the broader All Ordinaries index tumbled 101.4 points, or 1.63 per cent, to 6,128.4 points. ... Locally, in economic news on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia holds its monthly board meeting and announces its interest rate decision. The Australian Bureau of Statistics releases December retail trade figures, plus international trade in goods and services data, also for December. CNBC is calling today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhipsaw trading\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. With 10 minutes to go, the Dow is deep, deep, deep in the red, down over 1,000 points or 4%. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fear index is surging. The VIX index, which tracks volatility, has more than doubled to 35.7, its highest level since August 2015. Manufacturing group 3M is the biggest faller on the Dow right now, down 5.5% Oil firms Exxon and Chevron are close behind. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest market report: U.S. stocks sold off sharply on Monday, with the Dow industrials falling back below 25,000, as a pullback from record highs deepened and investors grappled with rising bond yields and potentially firming inflation. All three major U.S. indexes fell more than 1 percent while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 2 percent. Late in the session, the Dow is down more than 1,000 points. The energy, financials and healthcare sectors fell the most, but declines were spread broadly as all major 11 S&amp;P groups dropped. During Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session, the benchmark S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall on Monday put its pullback from its Jan 26 record high at more than 6 percent. Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report sparked worries over the prospects for inflation and a surge in bond yields, as well as concerns the Federal Reserve will raise rates at a faster pace than expected. Benchmark 10-year note yields pulled back after surging to 2.885 percent overnight, the highest since January. Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist with Allianz Global Investors in New York says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you have rates moving upwards, typically what happens is that financial conditions tighten, things like bank lending, mortgage lending start to slow and then the economy is at risk of a potential downturn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is an astonishing selloff. Shares are going through the floor on Wall Street. The Dow just extended its losses to 1,500 points - a fall of over 6% today. Christopher Vecchio of Daily FX suspects that the political tensions in Washington are contributing to the declines. ALERT: The Dow just plunged by 1,000 points, or almost 4%, wiping out all this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Update: The Dow just lost 800 points, or 3%, as this trading session turns increasingly wild. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off is actually threatening to exceed Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide. Worries over looming US interest rates, and the recent losses in the government bond market, are hitting shares harder in New York. Another wave of heavy selling has swept the Dow down by over 760 points - on top of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 665.75 drop. That takes the index firmly under the 25,000 mark, at 24758 With one hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading to go, can investors pull it back? If not, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be another day of chunky losses on Wall Street.... Digital currencies are also being hit hard today. Bitcoin has slumped by 18% to $6703 -- a fall of almost $1,500. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high of almost $20,000 feels a long way away. The sell off comes after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lloyds Bank said it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let customers buy digital currencies on their credit card - for fear of being left with hefty losses. With regulators in the UK, the US, China and South Korea all probing bitcoin, Miles Eakers of foreign exchange firm Centtrip predicts it will soon hit $5,000. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever has spotted something... I guess the president has been busy with one thing or another... The S&amp;P 500, which is a broader (and arguably better) measure of the US stock market, is also falling again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 1.6% at 2,717.48 points, a drop of 44 points. As things stand, the Dow has lost more than 1,000 points over the last two trading sessions. Once upon a time, that would have been a proper slump. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually only a 4% drop - thanks to the surge in stock prices over the last year. This is turning into a very skittish session on Wall Street. With 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow is now down 535 points, or over 2%. That takes it down to the 25,000 point mark - which it had smashed through for the first time at the start of January. Wall Street is solidly in the red again, with the Dow down almost 500 points (1.8%). Back on Wall Street, the sell off is speeding up. The global share sell-off from Friday has continued at the start of the new trading week, with European markets falling back and Wall Street going through a volatile start to the day. Amid signs of a stronger global economy, investors are worried that central banks might raise interest rates and stop the flow of cheap money more precipitously than previously expected. Stronger than expected US non-manufacturing data only added to the idea that a March rate hike is on the cards from the Federal Reserve, with up to another three to follow. European markets were also playing a bit of catch-up - or catch-down - since the bulk of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls on the Dow came after European traders had packed up for the weekend. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 108.45 points or 1.46% lower at 7334.98 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.76% to 12,687.49 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.48% down at 5285.83 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.64% to 22,821.63 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended off 1.44% at 10,064.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.48% to 853.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 370 points. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the day and be back tomorrow, barring any major developments before then. Thanks for reading and for all your comments. In fact Wall Street is now on the slide once more, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 300 points, in a marked sign of the current volatility. The Dow has fluctuated between a high of 25,520 at the open and a low of 25,165. Wall Street may be recovering, somewhat, but European markets remain under pressure. The FTSE 100 has dropped 1.46%, the biggest one day percentage fall since Theresa May called her snap general election on 18 April last year. This is the fifth consecutive day of losses for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index, and leaves it at its lowest level for around two months. The current stock market falls are a blip and not the start of a slide, according to Charles Stanley. Chief investment officer Jon Cunliffe said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity market wobbles belie positive corporate earnings and we think today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls should be regarded as a buying opportunity. The fourth-quarter earnings season painted a bright picture of good earnings deliver from companies across the globe. The positive relationship between a stronger global economic growth and revenues, with corporate earnings supported by improving pricing power supports margins. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 does not change this and we expect strong earnings growth to continue, with central banks being careful not to upset the apple-cart. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 70 points - not the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best but by no means the worst either. European markets, however, are showing little sign of improvement. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: European markets are firmly in the red as the global sell-off in stocks has taken hold. Ever since the US posted strong average earnings last Friday, traders have been rattled by the prospect of tighter monetary policy around the world. Economic indicators in the US, Europe and Asia point for a need to tighten up monetary policies from various central banks. Equity traders were enjoying a bullish run recently, and the jolt from the major decline in the US last Friday has triggered a worldwide round of profit taking. [In the US] traders are getting used to the idea that US interest rates could be hiked four times this year. Last Friday acted as a remained that stock markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go up in a straight line forever, and now we are seeing some short covering and bargain hunting. Chris Beauchamp, IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief market analyst, said: Signs of a recovery are in evidence on Wall Street, as the dust settles from what was one of the most volatile weeks in recent memory. Humans being what they are, the sudden downdraft seemed much worse than it was, especially compared with the volatility of 2015, but in reality it marks a return to a more normal market. Only time will tell whether we are about to see a resumption of the rally, or a bigger selloff. From current activity, it looks like calm has returned, with steady dip buying been seen on both sides of the Atlantic. It will take more than a few days of chaos to disrupt this bull market. Earnings season continues to provide the good news investors want to see, and while central bank tightening remains a worry, there is little sign that the Fed is in any hurry to quicken the pace. Draghi also warned: New headwinds have arisen from the recent volatility in the exchange rate, whose implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability require close monitoring. The eurozone economy is growing more strongly than expected, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, is telling the European parliament. But despite being more confident about the path of inflation, the bank still needs to be patient about monetary policy, he says. In his opening remarks, Draghi said: While we can be more confident about the path of inflation, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy is still warranted for underlying inflation pressures to build up and inflation to converge durably towards our objective. The recovery in US markets has done little to help their European counterparts, which are still nursing losses of around 1% (German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax excepted). Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Though the Dow Jones avoided the precipitous plunge promised by the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s futures, that ended up meaning very little to the European indices. Given that at one point the index was nearing 25100, the fact that it is flat around the 25500 mark is something of a coup for the Dow Jones. A stellar ISM services PMI likely helped, with the figure coming in far higher than forecast at 59.9, against the 56.5 expected and the 55.9 seen in December. The dollar, meanwhile, got revenge on the pound for its last few months of misery. Cable dropped 0.9%, informed not only by the new wave of hawkishness to hit the markets and that strong ISM non-manufacturing PMI, but the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own 17 month low-striking services reading and the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest round of Brexit in-fighting. Sterling also struggled against the euro, falling 0.6% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.128, its worst price against the single currency in 2 and a half weeks. Unusually the FTSE could find no joy in the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. The UK index was too busy dealing with the market-wide fear that a further rise in interest rates is on its way, sliding 1.1% as the day went on. The Eurozone indices, meanwhile, were a mixed bag. The DAX managed to reduce its losses to just 0.4%, following the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, but with the French CAC and Spanish IBEX down 1.1% and 1.2% respectively. Quite some turnaround on US markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down less than 100 points and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are in positive territory, helped by a rebound in technology stocks. Intel, for example, is higher on reports that Apple could use its chips in the next generation iPhone. The latest ISM surveys point to 3% growth in the US this year, as well as making a March rate hike likely barring unforeseen circumstances, says economist James Knightley at ING Bank: Both the non-manufacturing and the manufacturing ISMs are at incredibly strong levels, backing our call of 3% GDP growth in 2018. The US ISM non-manufacturing index has risen from a reading of 56.0 in December to 59.9 for January, suggesting the bad weather at the beginning of the month has failed to dent the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s momentum. In fact the headline index is at a twelve year high with the sub-components looking incredibly strong - employment is at its best ever level in the series\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 near 21 year history while new orders are at a seven year high. Production also rose while new export orders gained thanks to stronger global demand and the weaker dollar. With the non-manufacturing at 59.9 and the manufacturing ISM index at 59.1 versus a break-even 50 level the US economy looks in fantastic shape right now with tax cuts and the possibility of infrastructure investment adding more fuel to the fire. With wage growth also showing signs of life there is going to be growing pressure for the Fed to raise its economic forecasts and signal the potential for four rate hikes when they update their numbers at the March FOMC meeting. It will take something really big to prevent a March rate hike, with the most likely factor probably being a damaging government shutdown. In that regard Thursday is the next key date and so far there has been little sign of movement to break the deadlock. Following the better than expected non-manufacturing survey, Anthony Nieves, chair of the Institute for Supply Management, said: The non-manufacturing sector reflected strong growth in January after two consecutive months of pullback. Overall, the majority of respondents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments are positive about business conditions and the economy. They also indicated that recent tax changes have had a positive impact on their respective businesses. Here are some of the comments from those taking part in the ISM survey: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Executive management [is] excited about tax breaks for CapEx purchases in [the] new tax bill.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Information) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Month-over-month steady growth, on average, [is] 3 percent on project volume and 1 percent on total revenue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Construction) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Signs of strong growth [in] financial performance expectations given the recent tax changes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Positive outlook for 2018. We see huge pricing pressure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is starting off solid.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First quarter begins slow like 2017, but expect things to pick up later in Q1. Outlook continues to look bright for 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business activity is low due to the continued partial funding [of] bills passed (continuing resolutions).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Public Administration) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, sales velocity looks strong. Some regional differences due to weather conditions, but overall, a strong month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Wholesale Trade) Part of the reason for the current volatility in the stock market is the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates perhaps four times this year, as wage growth and inflation pick up. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The latest non-manufacturing figures may not be ground-breaking but the above expectations uptick will certainly be welcomed by the US government as it looks to further establish its jobs-boosting credentials. President Trump continues to boast of the success of his infrastructure investment and tax reforms, with the labour force and market growth both seemingly in rude health. The question now will be how these will affect interest rate decisions and how early the next hike will come. The markets have already priced in a heavy chance of a rate rise under new Fed Chair Jerome Powell next time out, and with a buoyant economy, stronger downward pricing pressures may well be needed in the coming months. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the other US service sector survey, and that has come in much stronger than expected. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI rose from 56 in December to 59.9 last month, better than the forecast figure of 56.5. This is the highest since August 2005, and will give more fuel to the argument that the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates several times this year. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a White House reaction to the current market turmoil, courtesy of CNBC: The US service sector is growing in line with expectations, according to the latest Markit survey. Its final service sector PMI for January came in at 53.3, in line with the initial estimate and down from the December figure of 53.7. The composite reading was also as forecast at 53.8, slightly lower than December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 54.1. In a few minutes, we get the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other US data, the non-manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management. One of the biggest US fallers is Wells Fargo after the Federal Reserve announced on Friday that the bank would be barred from growing past its $1.95tn assets, until it had improved its governance and controls. After Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls, US markets are continuing their decline, as investors continue to worry about rising interest rates and the removal of central bank support. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dropped 666 points on Friday, is down another 214 points or 0.8% in early trading. This is, so far, a better performance than the worst predictions. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.94% and the Nasdaq Composite fell just over 1%. The FTSE 100 is currently down 1.13% at 7359, but is off the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low of 7334. And with the weaker than expected UK services sector survey, the pound is continuing to decline, down 0.7% at $1.4019. Wall Street futures have come off their worst levels, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now tipped to open around 153 points lower. Stock markets around the world took another pummelling on Monday as investors continued to fret over rising U.S. bond yields. In Europe, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 lost 1.4% to 7,343 while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC 40 slid 1.4% to 5,288. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shed 1% to 12,654. Wall Street was poised to open lower with Dow futures and the broader S&amp;P 500 futures down 1%. Market jitters have spread after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in U.S. stock markets, when they endured their worst week in two years amid worries over rising Treasury yields. Fears of a sharp drop have ratcheted higher after 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong performance carried over into January. An upbeat U.S. jobs report showing higher than expected wage growth was the catalyst for the latest sharp sell-off on Friday, further stoking speculation the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates faster than expected to counter inflation. Higher bond yields make it more expensive for companies to borrow and potentially depresses the U.S. economy and earnings. They also can make bonds more attractive to investors than stocks. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA in London, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a sharp increase in U.S. bond yields over the last week after the Federal Reserve released a more hawkish than expected statement (on Wednesday), alongside its monetary policy decision, and the jobs data reported a significant increase in earnings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets now have three rate hikes this year more than 50 percent priced in and some people are even anticipating a fourth, which is unusually ahead of current Fed forecasts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is also having a bad day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently down 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.4045, a one-week low. Brexit uncertainty may be hurting sterling, as the UK cabinet argues over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with the EU: The sell-off across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floor is intensifying, dragging the Stoxx 600 down 1.3%. This means European stock markets have now fallen pretty steadily for a week. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why! The Wall Street futures are deteriorating, suggesting the Dow Jones industrial average could shed 300 points (on top of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 665 slump). Shares in London are dropping deeper into the red, following the news that Wall Street will fall at the open (at 2.30pm UK time). The FTSE 100 is now down 98 points, or 1.3%, at 7,344 points - a new two-month low. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says investors are reacting to the prospect of higher interest rates this year. The era of cheap money is ending, and for markets who got addicted to it, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s undoubtedly bad news Societe Generale (SG) are also concerned that shares and bonds are both falling. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the message from Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS. He argues that investors should sit tight, rather than ditching shares in response to the sell off. Maefele writes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that now is a time to reduce exposure to stocks. As long as the recent rise in bond yields moderates, we are confident that market conditions will remain orderly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, points out that markets did enjoy stellar returns last year: The start of the week has been a mirror image reversal to the optimism expressed in the start of the year and indeed in the last thirteen months when many major markets had raised over 25%-40%. After such a great performance some meaningful pullback is to be expected. The FTSE 100 has shed more than 1% this morning within hours of opening, taking the index under 7400. This also ends the remarkable rally that the markets have been experiencing the past year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! Bitcoin is now down 6% at $7690, a new two and a half-month low. The futures market is indicating that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market will fall at the open, extending last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines. The Dow is being called down 130 points, a drop of around 0.5%, having shed 665 points on Friday night. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a crash (of course!) but it may add to concerns that the market is experiencing a substantial correction after a very strong year. James Hughes of AxiTrader says: Stocks look like they are set for a correction of some sorts after huge losses over the last few sessions that has left many bulls worried that the bull run may have come to an end. On Friday the Dow dropped over 600 points with the S&amp;P and Nasdaq following suit. This morning Europe is catching the virus and is aggressively lower. The issue with this kind of fall is that it becomes a snowball effect, and after such astronomical gains since election day 2016 the falls can be equally as aggressive, but nobody could say that a correction hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been due. Jeremy Warner of the Daily Telegraph fears that a major stock market correction is looming. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses mean that FTSE 100 has shed around 5% since mid-January. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still around 2.5% higher than a year ago: Newsflash: Another 452 workers at stricken UK outsourcing group Carillion are being made redundant. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of the 377 who were laid off on Friday. That flurry of data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed the mood in the markets. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 and the European Stoxx 600 are both at two-month lows, as the global share rout continues. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: Volatility has returned with a vengeance and investors who had been hoping that the new week would see some respite from the selling have been left disappointed. European equity markets have now erased all their year to date gains as the market has reversed its euphoric start to the year and left investors with nowhere to hide. Newsflash: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector slowed sharply last month, as Brexit fears hit companies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit, whose UK service sector PMI fell to 53.0 last month, down from 54.2 in December and closer to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. This is the weakest reading since September 2016. Service sector bosses reported a slowdown in new work -- due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the loss of existing clients and lingering concerns surrounding the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Last week, Markit reported that UK manufacturing slowed in January, while construction slipped towards stagnation. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seems to have slowed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pace of UK economic growth slowed sharply at the start of the year as January saw a triple- whammy of weaker PMI surveys. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Service sector expansion slid to a 16-month low, reflecting a marked waning in growth of demand for business and consumer-facing services such as hotels and restaurants. Demand for transport and communication services was down for the second straight month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The softer service sector growth follows news of the manufacturing upturn losing momentum at the start of the year and a near-stagnant construction sector. All together, the PMI surveys point to the slowest pace of expansion since August 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the fourth quarter PMI readings were historically consistent with the economy growing at a resilient quarterly rate of 0.4-0.5%, in line with the recent GDP estimate, the January number signals a growth rate of just under 0.3% Quite a contrast with the eurozone, which posted its strongest month in over 11 years.... No sign of a recovery in the markets. After almost 90 minutes trading the FTSE 100 is still down 80 points, with most shares in the red. The slump in British car sales has continued. The number of new car registrations shrank by 6.3% year-on-year in January, with 163,615 vehicles driven away. Diesel sales suffered another sharp slump, down 25.6% during the month. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confusion over government policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd towards diesel cars, following the emissions scandal. The SMMT says: Demand fell across the board, with registrations by business, private and fleet buyers down -29.7%, -9.5% and -1.8% respectively. Meanwhile, continuing the trend of recent months, dual purpose cars (SUVs) were the only vehicle segment to see growth, with demand up 6.6% to account for a fifth (20.2%) of all new car registrations. Demand in all other segments fell, with the biggest declines affecting the mini, MPV and executive segments. Petrol sales rose by 8.5%, while electric cars surged by 23.9% compared with a year earlier. UK car sales shrank in 2017, for the first time in five years. Some good news! The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has posted its strongest monthly growth in over a decade. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite eurozone PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which tracks activity across the region, rose to 58.8 in January from 58.1 in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading since June 2006, and shows Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery remains on track. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: Bitcoin is also having a rough morning, after a UK bank launched a crackdown. The digital currency has shed 3.5% to $7,889, close to the two-month low it hit on Friday. Overnight, Lloyds Banking Group announced it has banned credit card customers from buying bitcoin. It fears that they could be left nursing heavy losses if prices fall. Anyone who bought bitcoin last December, when it peaked at around $20,000, has already suffered sharp losses.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing an rough start to trading in London, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx, with all January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and most of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains now been wiped out. Campbell writes: There were ugly, ugly scenes after the bell, as the market-wide sell-off gathered pace on fears that global interest rate are, sooner rather than later, going to be heading higher. The FTSE quickly shed 1% this Monday, taking the index to sub-7400 levels not seen in 8 weeks. The UK index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp losses over the last 3 weeks have effectively wiped out the remarkable, record-breaking rise it saw in the pre- and post-New Year period, with little good news on the horizon to rescue it from its current levels. Nearly every share on the FTSE 100 has dropped this morning, as the blue-chip index slides to its two-month low. Mobile phone network operator Vodafone is leading the selloff, following reports that it could buy European assets from Liberty Global. Budget airline easyJet is also under pressure, after rival Ryanair warned that trading this year could be tougher than expected. The only risers are DIY chain Kingfisher and hotels and coffee shop chain Whitbread. Traders will be watching nervously to see how the US stock market opens in five hours time, says financial analyst and journalist Louise Cooper. Other European stock markets are also falling in early trading, dragging the benchmark Stoxx 600 down by over 1%. Fears over the bond market (see earlier post), and the looming prospect of higher interest rates are hitting shares in Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid and Milan. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets argues that this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorrection\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is overdue. The biggest sell-off for the equity markets in nearly two years is here as investors are reacting to surging global bond yields. Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity markets rout is likely to extend as the futures of the US stock indices are indicating. However, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much to worry about because corporate profits are still rising and chances of US recession are remote. So this may only be a healthy pullback which the investors have been waiting for some time. A 10% correction could take place as this was long overdue. In other words, the long-term momentum for the equity markets is only easing off as these markets have been defying the Newton Law of Gravity. Investors in London are playing catch-up after Friday afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp selloff on Wall Street (which accelerated after UK traders had gone home for the weekend). Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The next day after an unusually big sell-off is always a big test of a market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength. A repeat of anything close to the 2% decline seen in US indices on Friday could trigger a prolonged period of risk-off sentiment. Last week the S&amp;P 500 dropped -3.8%, with the energy sector leading the declines. After gains of 6% in January, the first few days of February were always going to be at risk of profit taking. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off! Trading is underway in the City, and there are losses across the board as investors join the global sell-off. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has shed 80 points, or 1.1%, taking the blue-chip index down to 7360 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since 8th December. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, reckons that the markets could suffer a 10% fall - but not a full-blown crash. He writes: The past week has seen shares come under pressure as Fed rate hike expectations increased, partly reflecting an acceleration in US wages growth, and the bond yield rose sharply. From their recent high, US shares have fallen 3.9% making it the deepest pullback since a 4.8% fall prior to the November 2016 US election. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely the pullback has further to go as investors adjusts to more Fed tightening than currently assumed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we see four (or possibly five) Fed rate hikes this year against market expectations for three - and higher bond yields. This will impact most major share markets, including the Australian share market which is vulnerable given its high exposure to yield plays like real estate investment trusts and utilities. However, the pullback is likely to be just an overdue correction (with say a 10% or so fall) rather than a severe bear market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c providing the rise in bond yields is not too abrupt and recession is not imminent in the US with profits continuing to rise. So the two key questions are how severe the back up in bond yields will be and whether a recession is approaching? Government bonds are falling in early trading, extending their recent losses. The yield, or interest rate, on German 10-year bonds has hit its highest level since September 2015. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still low in historical terms, at just 0.77%, but it shows that prices have hit their lowest in almost two and a half years. Bonds are being hit by worries about rising inflation, which would put pressure on central banks to raise interest rates. US government debt (Treasury bills) have weakened sharply - pushing the yield on 10-year Treasuries to a four-year high. UK government debt is also weakening, pushing up the yield on 10-year gilts to the highest level since May 2016. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The financial markets are a sea of red this morning, as the biggest sell-off since Donald Trump won the US presidency gathers pace. Investors are increasingly spooked that global interest rates are heading higher, bringing the long era of loose monetary policy and easy money to a close. On Friday, Wall Street suffered its biggest decline since the Brexit vote. The Dow tumbled by 2,5%, or almost 666 points in a nervy selloff (the biggest points fall since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Europe and Asia are now following suit. Over in Japan, the Nikkei has fallen by 2.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fall since the US presidential election in November 2016. There were also losses in South Korea (-1.1%) and Australia (-1.5%). Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader in Australia, warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a nervous start to the week for traders across all markets as they wonder if last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reversal in US stocks and the ugly close Friday ... is likely the start of something bigger, In London, investors are bracing for the FTSE 100 to shed more than 1% when trading begins at 8am GMT. Government bonds are also falling, amid growing concern that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank will hike borrowing costs more aggressively than expected. Some analysts think that Fed could raise rates four times this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the market had previously only priced in three rises. Traders will also be watching for a new healthcheck on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector companies.

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Why are markets down? In part, because they have gone up too far too fast and were ripe for a fall. More importantly, it is because central banks have supplied copious amounts of money to the markets at ultra-low interest rates. In recent days, investors have looked at rising bond yields, higher wage growth and dearer commodity prices and started to fret about something that has not concerned them in recent years: inflation.

Trump has a lot riding on the stock market continuing to rise and certainly did not choose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/02/jay-powell-federal-reserve-janet-yellen\">Jerome Powell</a> to be the chairman of the Fed because he thought his appointee was an interest-rate hawk.</p> \n<p>The falls on Wall Street were triggered by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-job-numbers-and-wage-growth-are-up-but-inequality-is-also-on-the-rise\">showed unemployment at 4.1% and a pick-up in average hourly earnings</a>.

Wall Street investors are confident Powell will see them all right.</p> \n<p>If this all sounds familiar, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it is. During Alan Greenspan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long reign at the Fed, Wall Street knew the central bank would ride to the rescue every time share prices plunged.

Trump has a lot riding on the stock market continuing to rise and certainly did not choose Jerome Powell to be the chairman of the Fed because he thought his appointee was an interest-rate hawk. The falls on Wall Street were triggered by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report, which showed unemployment at 4.1% and a pick-up in average hourly earnings. But Powell would not have to look all that hard to find reasons for a gradual, market-pleasing, rise in interest rates rather than rapid tightening. Wall Street investors are confident Powell will see them all right. If this all sounds familiar, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it is. During Alan Greenspan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long reign at the Fed, Wall Street knew the central bank would ride to the rescue every time share prices plunged. It became known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Greenspan put\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Powell put\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be equally disastrous, not immediately but in the longer term. Why? Because it would reward recklessness, blow up an even bigger bubble and create the conditions for a rerun of 2008.",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sell-off accelerated in a chain reaction,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told Kyodo News.<br></p> \n<p>Other markets across Asia also suffered losses.

                "bodyText":"Fears of another plunge in Wall Street shares proved unfounded on Tuesday after the Dow Jones shrugged off an initial 500-point drop to post early gains. It was a volatile open session as shares fell further into the red before investors regained their nerve and the Dow rose 184 points or 0.6% to 24,527. The gains followed the biggest ever one-day points fall on the US index on Monday, when the Dow plunged by 1,175 as traders bet on interest rate rises. The FTSE 100 of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest listed companies initially fell by 255 points or 3.5% to 7,079.41 as the turmoil spread to global markets. The index later recovered some of its losses, and was down 138 points or 1.9% at 7,196. Investors took fright elsewhere in Europe as trading got under way, with markets in Germany, France, Italy and Spain all down by more than 3%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The stock market open in the UK and Europe looks about as bad as it can get,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jasper Lawler, the head of research at online trading firm London Capital Group. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bloodbath on Wall Street, which was repeated in Asia has seen confidence evaporate in Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Falls in Europe followed a near 5% drop in Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark Nikkei 225 index and a 3.3% fall on Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ASX200. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index declined by as much as 7% during the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade before a slight recovery to close down 4.7%. The Nikkei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline of 1,071.84 points was its largest points fall since 2016. Maki Sawada, from the investment research and investor services department at Nomura Securities Co, said stocks were being sold in panic after the Wall Street losses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sell-off accelerated in a chain reaction,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told Kyodo News. Other markets across Asia also suffered losses. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Composite Stock Price Index fell by about 3% in morning trade. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index plunged 4.9% while the Shanghai Composite index lost 2.2%. These losses followed the dive in the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday, with investors appearing to react to equity losses and concerns that central banks will soon increase interest rates to rein in inflation. It coincided with the arrival of Jerome Powell as the new chair of the US Federal Reserve. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was volatility unleashed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer at at Cresset Wealth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partially fear of interest rates, partially this new Fed chairman Jerome Powell, partially the market is overvalued relative to fundamentals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While market fear may not be based in any change in economic fundamentals, in its last meeting under chair Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve indicated it expects inflation pressures to increase through the year. According to projections released in December, officials expect three rate hikes in 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so long as market conditions remain broadly as they are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but some economists believe the central bank could add another increase at its final meeting of the year. If the market falls continue they could prove problematic for Donald Trump who has consistently touted record high stock markets as proof that his presidency is boosting the economy. US stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February. However, the White House, responding to the market drop insisted on Monday night that long-term economic fundamentals \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain exceptionally strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Vice President Mike Pence characterised the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simply the ebb and flow of our stock market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates.

Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>2 Interest rates</h2> \n<p>Rates have been kept low for two decades, flushing economies with liquidity and causing bubbles to inflate, pop and form again.

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The losses in Europe and Asia followed concerns that central banks will increase interest rates this year by more than expected in response to inflationary pressures from surging global economies.</p> \n<p>In her last meeting as chair of the Federal Reserve last week, Janet Yellen hinted that stronger than expected inflation could prompt the central bank to review its policy of three rate increases this year.

Instead, he highlights several reasons to be worried. For example:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The past couple of days have shown one thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that there was an awful lot of money betting on tranquillity via various financial products manufactured by investment banks. Did a wipeout of some of these low-volatility funds feed the selling pressures on Monday? Almost certainly. But is that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd factor a temporary sideshow that can be ignored? Not necessarily. It may be evidence that other risks have been packaged up and sold as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually the reverse. When investors are fed cheap money for a decade, dumb bets can be made. </p> <p>Plus, the prelude to the drama was a rapid rise in the yield on 10-year US treasuries from 2.4% to 2.8%. This, we are told, happened because the strong news on jobs and wages means the US Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates three times this year. That explanation is entirely plausible. But a 10-year yield of 2.8% is still low by historical standards. What would something more normal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c say, 4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do? If the deflation dragon really has been slain and the Trump administration is dishing out tax cuts, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t 4% a possibility? On the evidence of the past week, the stock market may not adjust easily.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/feb/06/a-stock-market-correction-such-group-think-is-alarming\">Groupthink about Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorrection\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is slightly alarming | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7a02aae4b00694282733b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T19:34:42.370Z\">7.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Wall Street continues to see-saw, and with 90 minutes trading left the main indices are in the red.</strong></p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 has shed 0.5% (on top of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4.1% fall), while the Dow remains pretty volatile - currently down 0.2%.</p> <p>Investors continue to blame the prospect of rising US interest rates, and signs that wages are finally picking up.</p> <p>As Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, puts it (via the FT):<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I still think this is a continued reaction to the very rapid rise in interest rates and inflation expectations over a short period of time.</p> <p>We are just seeing some continued selling after a very long period of a complacent environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a79ff93e4b07d68a97f631d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T19:24:26.321Z\">7.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How the market turmoil hit the world's wealthiest</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest people are a little less rich today, thanks to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem.</strong></p> <p>Bloomberg has calculated that Warren Buffett, the veteran investor, lost $5.1bn on Monday.

The Dow is at 24,423 (now up on the day) trading at a level that was last seen just two months ago. </p> <p> This sell off has been a technical phenomenon, there has not been a change in fundamentals.

Its chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The slump in equity markets would have to go a lot further to cause economic growth to slow significantly. That may yet happen, but for now prospects for global growth still look fairly bright. </p> <p>The fall in global equity prices over the past few days has been unusually sudden, but it is not yet exceptionally large. The MSCI World equity index has fallen by 6% from its peak last week. As a comparison, there have been four instances of double-digit percentage falls in the index since the financial crisis. These occurred in 2010 (-15%), 2011 (-20%), 2012 (-13%) and 2015/16 (-17%). </p> <p>It is of course quite possible that equities will fall much further in the coming days or weeks, or even hours! After all, valuations are high by past standards and the MSCI World index is still 17% above its level a year ago. But even if this happens, the fallout for the economy may still be quite small.</p> <p>... Stock markets often send a false signal about the outlook for economic growth. And there has been only a small increase in corporate bond yields, which have a better track record in signalling slowdowns. The most reliable leading indicators of economic activity, such as the global PMIs and the US ISM non-manufacturing index published yesterday, suggest that the world economy is firing on all cylinders. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a79d9cfe4b0faf969c78881\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T16:43:06.899Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 suffers biggest one day fall since Brexit vote</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 has dropped by 2.64% or 193 points to its lowest level since last April.</p> <p>This is the biggest percentage drop since the day after the UK referendum on Europe, and marks the sixth successive trading day of declines.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a79d6dae4b07d68a97f6126\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T16:27:23.440Z\">4.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncertainty continues, and it is now down 141 points.

But Powell would not have to look all that hard to find reasons for a gradual, market-pleasing, rise in interest rates rather than an aggressive tightening. If the current turmoil continues, Powell will no doubt seek to reassure the markets.</p> <p>If this all sounds familiar, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it is.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great news - except it could force the US central bank to hike borrowing costs more aggressively. Investors are now factoring in four American interest rate hikes this year - up from three before.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting that markets surged in 2017, thanks to optimism over the global economy. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts gave shares another lift -- because cutting corporation tax is good for profits.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-spending-debt-analysis-20180203-story.html\">But.. those same tax cuts could force America to borrow more money to cover its budget deficit</a>. That would probably push down the value of US government debt, and push up the interest rate (or yield) on those bonds. Again, that could force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. </p> <p>It could also make bonds a more attractive investment - another reason to ditch shares today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/05/why-are-global-stock-markets-falling\">Why are global stock markets falling?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T08:31:22.252Z\">at 8.31am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a796633e4b081f9d0100415\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T08:27:45.588Z\">8.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sign up to our email</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Guardian Business offers a daily email covering markets, the economy, companies news, property and much more.</p> <p>Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day.</p> <p>For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7964e8e4b0c56a1f8b7546\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T08:23:33.657Z\">8.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European stocks hit hard</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>European stocks have fallen to their lowest level since last August, as traders hit the sell button at bourses across the continent.</strong></p> <p>The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies, has fallen by 3.1% this morning.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap, after another hectic day in the markets. The US stock market has roared back from its slump on Monday, in a highly volatile trading session. After initially sliding, the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day with its biggest jump in over a year - up 567 points. Cue smiles on Wall Street between relieved traders. The rally came as several analysts argued that the markets were going through a correction, not embarking on a crash. The US government also tried to calm nerves, with Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin arguing that the markets were functioning well. European stock markets, though, suffered heavy falls. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 endured its biggest slump since the Brexit vote, falling by 193 points or 2.6% -- wiping \u00c2\u00a350bn off the index. Asian markets also tumbled on Tuesday -- but there are signs that they will recover in the upcoming trading session. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark index is being called higher. But the bigger picture is that the markets look nervous, with investors worrying about potential US interest rate rises. With $4 trillion wiped off shares in the last week, further volatility seems highly likely in the days ahead. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all from us today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the markets: Goodnight! What a difference a day makes. Traders on the floor of the New York stock exchange are grinning and sharing high fives, after seeing shares recover this afternoon. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, has commented on the US stock markets - and insisted that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is robust. Sanders says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look, the economy is incredibly strong right now. The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus right now continues to be on the long term economic fundamentals which, like I just said, are very strong in this country. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re infinitely better off today than we were before the president took office, particularly on the economy. We have historically low unemployment and we actually have increasing wages for American workers. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very comfortable with where we are right now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sanders added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Does the president have second thoughts about taking credit for a booming economy? Absolutely not.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is the S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best one-day gain, in percentage terms, since November 2016. Quite a recovery, given it had its worst day in six years yesterday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 closing market report: U.S. stocks posted sharp gains in another wild trading session on Tuesday, as indexes rebounded from the biggest one-day drops for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow in more than six years that stalled the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record run. Stocks swung from negative to positive after indexes started the session 2% lower, underscoring a return of volatility to a market that until recently was marked by an absence of major shifts. The Dow had a more than 1,100-point difference between its high and low on Tuesday. The sharp declines in recent days marked a pullback that had been long awaited by investors after the market minted record high after record high in a relatively calm ascent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite violent moves in the last couple days in the market, fundamentals in the economy are very strong and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just the U.S., it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throughout the global economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Alicia Levine, head of global investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 567.02 points, or 2.33%, to 24,912.77, the S&amp;P 500 gained 46.2 points, or 1.74%, to 2,695.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 148.36 points, or 2.13%, to 7,115.88. Technology, materials and consumer discretionary were the top-performing sectors on Tuesday. Defensive sectors utilities and real estate were the only major S&amp;P groups to end negative. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revival was led by chemicals firm Dow DuPont, retail chain Home Depot, tech giant Apple and oil producer Chevron, which all gained at least 4%. BREAKING: The US stock market has bounced from its worst day in six years. As the closing bell rings out across the New York stock exchange, the Dow Jones is up around 567 points, or 2.33%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a swing, given the Dow fell over 500-points at the start of trading today. That means it has recovered around half Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,175-point rout. The broader S&amp;P 500 also bounced back, as did the tech-focused Nasdaq. Investors will be relieved that shares haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffered further losses today. But...there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no argument that volatility is back, after a long period of calm in the financial markets. With just a few minutes trading left, Wall Street has managed to recover its poise. The Dow and the Nasdaq are both up over 2%. Fact of the day.... John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial of North Carolina sums up the day: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a crazy period and today the market is probably just trying to find some footing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a stark contrast to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wobbles, the Dow just surged by 600 points -- suggesting we could recover half of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses... Can the Dow hang on? With 30 minutes to go, the US stock market is up... but not so strongly that a late slump can be ruled out. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our colleague Philip Inman on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market action: Shares in London plunged for a sixth day and by the largest amount since the Brexit vote, as concerns grew that febrile global stock markets, which have lost $4tn (\u00c2\u00a32.9tn) in value since Friday, were in the grip of panic-selling. The FTSE 100 slumped 2.6% to 7,141 to wipe all the gains from this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading and set the index of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable companies on course for a second week of losses. Investors took fright elsewhere in Europe, with markets in Germany, France and Spain all closing down by more than 2%. Stocks also tumbled across Asia earlier in the day. The Tokyo Nikkei 225 index was among the worst affected after shares fell by more than 4% to 21,620, leaving them 12% down on last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak of 24,120. Wall Street, where the global stock market rout began on Monday, had a second day of volatile, high volume trading with wild swings in share prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 2.2% following the opening bell before recovering within half an hour to a gain of more than 1%, then see-sawing further through the session.... One reason the Australian market is set to bounce back is that another record half-yearly profit is expected from Commonwealth Bank, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest company. It is forecast by analysts to announce six-month earnings of about A$5.2 billion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up 6% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite its regulatory woes. The Australian banking sector is enormous and has benefited from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extended house prices boom, although there are signs that is stalling. The big four retail banks - Commonwealth, Westpac, ANZ and NAB \u00e2\u20ac\u201c together with Macquarie Bank make up a whopping 25% of the ASX200. So, after shedding a record 1,175 points last night, the Dow is on track to recover a significant chunk of them...... The S&amp;P 500 is also putting on a late spurt. The Dow is continuing to rise in late trading - now up 504 points, or over 2%, at 24,850. There are signs that Asia-Pacific markets will rally on Wednesday. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ASX200 benchmark has lost A$85bn in value in two days but is set to bounce back on Wednesday, according to futures trading. It is expected to rise around 1.25% at the opening bell at 10am Sydney time, which is 11pm GMT (or two hours after Wall Street closes) The rally is back on again! As Wall Street enters its final hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is making a late charge. The Dow is now up 370 points, or 1.45% at 24,716. A lot of experts have argued today that the current selloff is just a much-needed correction, not the start of a crash. But our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by this breezy optimism. Instead, he highlights several reasons to be worried. For example: The past couple of days have shown one thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that there was an awful lot of money betting on tranquillity via various financial products manufactured by investment banks. Did a wipeout of some of these low-volatility funds feed the selling pressures on Monday? Almost certainly. But is that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd factor a temporary sideshow that can be ignored? Not necessarily. It may be evidence that other risks have been packaged up and sold as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually the reverse. When investors are fed cheap money for a decade, dumb bets can be made. Plus, the prelude to the drama was a rapid rise in the yield on 10-year US treasuries from 2.4% to 2.8%. This, we are told, happened because the strong news on jobs and wages means the US Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates three times this year. That explanation is entirely plausible. But a 10-year yield of 2.8% is still low by historical standards. What would something more normal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c say, 4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do? If the deflation dragon really has been slain and the Trump administration is dishing out tax cuts, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t 4% a possibility? On the evidence of the past week, the stock market may not adjust easily. More here: Wall Street continues to see-saw, and with 90 minutes trading left the main indices are in the red. The S&amp;P 500 has shed 0.5% (on top of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4.1% fall), while the Dow remains pretty volatile - currently down 0.2%. Investors continue to blame the prospect of rising US interest rates, and signs that wages are finally picking up. As Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, puts it (via the FT): I still think this is a continued reaction to the very rapid rise in interest rates and inflation expectations over a short period of time. We are just seeing some continued selling after a very long period of a complacent environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest people are a little less rich today, thanks to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem. Bloomberg has calculated that Warren Buffett, the veteran investor, lost $5.1bn on Monday. But that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop him buying a can of his favourite cherry coke, as the Sage of Omaha is still worth $85bn. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Zuckerberg took the second-biggest hit - losing $3.6bn, with Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeff Bezos close behind. More here. Update: Dow now down 85 points. Back in London, traders are counting the damage after the FTSE 100 suffered its biggest one-day fall since the Brexit vote. Financial stocks had a bad day, with Standard Life and Schroders down over 5%. Utility stocks also suffered - National Grid and United Utilities lost over 4%. Healthcare and technology also brought up the rear. The Evening Standard has worked out that \u00c2\u00a350bn was wiped off the value of companies on the Footsie today, as the index shed 193 points or 2.6%. After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wild drama, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in Asia and Europe, shares are finally looking calmer. The Dow is now bobbing around its opening levels, as traders take a breather and try to anticipate the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t relax! Wall Street has a habit of becoming more volatile towards the end of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session. So with two hours to go, we could yet see big gains or losses. And.... the Dow has turned negative again  , down 35 points. Travelers Companies, the insurance group, is currently the biggest faller, down 2.6%. Oil giant Exxonis down 2.5%, followed by pharma group Merck (-2.15%) and Coca-Cola (-1.85%) Having been up, and down, and up, and down, the Dow Jones is currently 100 points higher today (+0.4) at 24,446. But trading remains jittery, so do not try this at home (or in the office!): Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investor and businessman Carl Icahn on the markets, courtesy CNBC: IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld has added his voice to those saying the economic fundamentals are strong despite the current market turmoil. If Wall Street seems incapable of deciding which direction to stick with, there was no such hesitation in Europe. With the global concerns about rising interest rates and a spate of catching up with Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump in the Dow, European markets have suffered deep declines. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 193.58 points or 2.64% to 7141.40, its biggest daily percentage decline since the Brexit vote Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 2.32% to 12,392.66 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 2.35% at 5161.81 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 2.08% to 22,347.01 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 2.53% lower at 9810.0 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.74% to 838.80 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 201 points or 0.79% while the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.2 points or 0.08%. The sell-off in stock markets does not relate to economic fundamentals, agrees City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta: Whipsaw action is sending equity indices on a wild ride on Tuesday. As the bulls battle the bears US stocks have opened trading a wide range. The Dow had moved through 934 points early on as investors were keen to pick up bargains but fear that it is still too early to call the bottom.... The CBOE volatility Index, also known as the VIX, or fear gauge remains at elevated levels on Tuesday spiking to 50 before retracing back to 40, an increase of 7% on the day. Stepping back from the trading ranges and looking at the levels that Wall Street is trading at and suddenly it is possible to gain some perspective on the numbers. The Dow is at 24,423 (now up on the day) trading at a level that was last seen just two months ago. This sell off has been a technical phenomenon, there has not been a change in fundamentals. Right now, this is offering little comfort to traders looking to buy the dips and being wiped out by automated selling. Here, from our colleagues in New York, is a quick run through some of the reasons for the current stock market uncertainty: The stock market falls should have little impact on the overall global economy, say Capital Economics. Its chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said: The slump in equity markets would have to go a lot further to cause economic growth to slow significantly. That may yet happen, but for now prospects for global growth still look fairly bright. The fall in global equity prices over the past few days has been unusually sudden, but it is not yet exceptionally large. The MSCI World equity index has fallen by 6% from its peak last week. As a comparison, there have been four instances of double-digit percentage falls in the index since the financial crisis. These occurred in 2010 (-15%), 2011 (-20%), 2012 (-13%) and 2015/16 (-17%). It is of course quite possible that equities will fall much further in the coming days or weeks, or even hours! After all, valuations are high by past standards and the MSCI World index is still 17% above its level a year ago. But even if this happens, the fallout for the economy may still be quite small. ... Stock markets often send a false signal about the outlook for economic growth. And there has been only a small increase in corporate bond yields, which have a better track record in signalling slowdowns. The most reliable leading indicators of economic activity, such as the global PMIs and the US ISM non-manufacturing index published yesterday, suggest that the world economy is firing on all cylinders. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 2.64% or 193 points to its lowest level since last April. This is the biggest percentage drop since the day after the UK referendum on Europe, and marks the sixth successive trading day of declines. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncertainty continues, and it is now down 141 points. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 started the day very much offside, and then managed to drive into positive territory only to slip back again.... Traders don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know which way to turn as uncertainty is running high. The colossal range on the US indices sum up how irrational equity traders are at the moment, and while some go bargain hunting, others are fearful we could see another leg lower. The S&amp;P 500 by the way is down 12 points or 0.44%. The current market sell off is just a correction, said Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, but he also told senators that algorithmic trading had an impact. He told the House Financial Services Committee that markets were functioning very well, although the administration was monitoring the situation. He said he was not overly concerned about the recent sell-off, and that market fundamentals were strong. There were no financial stability implications in the recent market moves, he added. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a graph showing the volatility in the Dow Jones Industrial Average so far today: And there appears to be real trading out there. Volumes are around 250m compared to an average of about 139m, which appears to be the highest since the December Federal Reserve meeting (H/T Neil Wilson of ETX Capital). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a chaotic start on Wall Street, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell. And with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 170 points, it is hard to disagree. Campbell says: The Dow was all over the place after the bell. With the futures promising the index was going to spill its guts, it was a welcome relief that the index instead quickly shifted into the green. The index is still pretty damn volatile, however.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting that the Dow did something similar yesterday, ducking an immediate bloodbath only to completely lose its bottle by the end of the session. Elsewhere, the Vix volatility index has fallen back sharply (ironic, given how volatile the Dow is at the moment). After hitting a level of 50 earlier, the Vix is now down 33% on the day at 24.7. The Dow is all over the place. After the initial 550 point fall and the subsequent 350 point rise, the Dow is now up just 50 points or so. What it will close at is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess, but the recent falls do seem to have attracted some buyers. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The valuations were certainly looking attractive on a forward earnings basis, providing attract entry points for a number of stocks. Some deep-pocketed funds may have stepped in to hoover up what they could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in this context it looks for the time being like the correction was exactly what the market needed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although we have a long way to go today still and sentiment is still fragile after two bruising sessions. The White House, and specifically the recent tax cuts, have played a part in the current market volatility, says Royal London Asset Management: US stock market volatility continues to spike higher as the strongest wage inflation in the US since 2009 triggered fears of faster than expected rises in interest rates. While Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House has correctly pointed to strong economic fundamentals as a more important long term story and the role of the tax cuts in driving this, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve failed to appreciate the impact that their policies could have on inflation, and therefore the path of interest rates. Royal London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of multi asset Trevor Greetham added: Investors welcomed the announcements of tax cuts but are starting to get second thoughts as the consequences of adding stimulus late in the business cycle become clear. Unemployment is low and the potential for strong wage inflation once US tax cuts take effect has spooked markets, given what this means for US interest rate policy. Although rising interest rates pose a challenge to the stock market, this will only become a serious one once they are high enough to cause the economy to roll over. With the Fed Funds rate still below the level of core inflation in the US, that could take quite a while. We expect bouts of volatility like this to become more common now the Federal Reserve is in play, but expect stocks to recover over the coming weeks and months, making recent market moves look like an overreaction. The early recovery in US markets gives some credence to those who believe the recent falls were a much needed market correction rather than the precursor to a wider sell-off. One of those is Sven Balzer, head of investment strategy at Coutts: This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market falls show a much needed market correction after a long period of strong performance, and little more. Global economic growth remains strong and there are no signs of a US recession, which usually heralds a wider sell-off... In our view, this is a short-term correction driven by technical factors rather than concerns about the underlying economic picture or corporate health. While this can be unnerving for investors, we see a robust economic and corporate environment that should continue to support equities. Go Wall Street! Instead of sinking into the mire, the Dow is now up 350 points, or 1.4%. That means leading shares have recovered around a third of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble. Although the Dow Jones industrial average gets a lot of attention, serious stock market traders pay more attention to the S&amp;P 500. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it contains more companies (500, instead of the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 30), so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a better measure of the actual US stock market. And after an early wobble, the S&amp;P 500 is now positive too -- up 1% or 27 points at 2,676 points. Wall Street is fighting back! After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wild swings, the Dow has clawed back its opening falls - and is now up 0.13%. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make much of a dent in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, but investors will be relieved that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not worse. Still early days though! After a rocky start, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has turned positive. Things are settling down on Wall Street. After six minutes trading, the Dow is now down 157 points -- perhaps traders are resisting the temptation to sell everything. DING DING goes the opening bell of Wall Street, triggering another wave of selling. The Dow Jones industrial average has swiftly shed 547 points, a fall of 2.25%, on top of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,175 slide. That takes the Dow into correction territory, down more than 10% from its peak. But...the index is swiftly rebounding from those lows, as traders get stuck in. More to follow! Right. Deep breath time. After its biggest sell-off in six years, Wall Street is about to reopen. The futures market is still jittery, as traders try to anticipate the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move. Just seven minutes to go...... Veteran City analyst George Magnus has a deeply worrying take. He thinks markets are wobbling because the US government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit is likely to spike over the next couple of years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the new Tax Cut and Jobs Act will force Washington to borrow much more to balance its books -- at a time when the economy should be strong (so borrowing should be low). Magnus writes: Trillion dollar deficits are just over the horizon, which will cause US government debt as a share of GDP to rise in the next several years to over 100 per cent. While debt levels alone cannot predict what will happen to bond yields, the markets fear that significant unfunded government borrowing\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially when the economy is doing well\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwill cause the Federal Reserve to carry on raising interest rates, in turn pushing bond yields higher. On current trends, this cyclical shift will eventually, maybe in 2019, puncture the stock market, corporate profits, and most likely the economy. More here: With 20 minutes until the Wall Street open, a chunky sell-off still looks likely.... Bears are running rampant through the global markets today, following Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout on Wall Street, says Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM. He questions whether the recent losses are merely a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchealthy correction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as some investors claim. A sense of anxiety amongst investors over central banks raising interest rates faster than expected, remains one of the likely culprits behind the global sell-off. In Asia, equities were a sea of red during early trade and the negative domino effect has already punished European markets. With Wall Street suffering its largest one-day decline in more than six years on Monday, US stocks could remain depressed this afternoon. Ongoing weakness across stock markets may prompt investors to start questioning if the global sell-off could be more than a correction but something greater. Take a deep breath, stock market traders. The opening of Wall Street is 50 minutes away, and heavy falls look likely: Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, says the financial markets are adjusting to a new world where central bankers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t propping assets up through loose monetary policy. He writes: Interest rates are rising at a time when the economy needs money for the increased corporate investment activity which is taking place. That means there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the constant flow of money into the equity market which has been supporting prices over the last couple of years. As I said before the year ended, the real challenge for investors after an environment of very low volatility is that they may be unnerved as it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normalises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More volatility means more opportunity for active investors with strong nerves. We see the recent sell off as validating rather than challenging that assessment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has widened to its highest level since the financial crisis. New figures from the Commerce Department show that the US imported $53.1bn more than it exported in December 2017, an increase of 5.3%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest monthly deficit since 2008. The data also show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap with China hit a new all-time high of over $375bn for 2017, despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to cut it as part of his America First agenda. Traders on Wall Street are expecting fresh losses when the market opens in around 90 minutes time. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,175-point slump on the Dow has left many traders bruised and nervous, as the long run of calm market conditions comes to an abrupt halt. Volatility is continuing to rise today, to levels not seen since August 2015 -- adding to the anxiety in New Jork. Andre Bakhos, managing director of New Vines Capital, has told Reuters that fear is stalking the markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The one thing I could say with confidence is that volatility has suddenly come back into the market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The declines in markets are steep and vicious and are fostering a feeling of fear which begets irrational behavior. So this market is now driven on fear of rates and [rising] wages. That basically means good news now is bad news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The volatility has caused investors to be fast on their feet. It is a true traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 atmosphere as opposed to the conditions we have been accustomed to - buy and go higher.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The turmoil in the markets today has disrupted Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to issue a new government bond. That seven-year bond was an important stage in Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 escape from its bailout programme. Our correspondent Helena Smith in Athens explains: Barely 24 hours after the mandate was announced, it was decided not to push ahead with what would have been the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boldest market foray in almost eight years under international bailout programmes. It was assumed the seven-year issue would price today but one lead manager said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we felt it would be prudent to wait for some stability. Greece doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do deals very often and wants to make sure it works.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Athens had hoped to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn. The country is due to exit its current EU-IMF bailout programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its third since May 2010 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in August and has pledged to make several market forays in order to build up a cash buffer of up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19bn to cover debt repayments once the programme officially expires. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaping up for a rough opening on Wall Street..... Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at a stock market correction - not a crash. He argues that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new top central banker, Jerome Powell, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay on the sidelines for long. If the selloff continues, surely Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve will wind back the tightening of monetary policy (the equivalent of pouring a bit more gin into the punch bowl). Larry argues: Trump has a lot riding on the stock market continuing to rise and certainly did not choose Jerome Powell to be the chairman of the Fed because he thought his appointee was an interest-rate hawk. The falls on Wall Street were triggered by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report, which showed unemployment at 4.1% and a pick-up in average hourly earnings. But Powell would not have to look all that hard to find reasons for a gradual, market-pleasing, rise in interest rates rather than an aggressive tightening. If the current turmoil continues, Powell will no doubt seek to reassure the markets. If this all sounds familiar, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it is. During Alan Greenspan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long reign at the Fed, Wall Street knew the central bank would ride to the rescue every time share prices plunged. It became known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Greenspan put\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The problem for Powell is that the Greenspan put was ultimately disastrous. It encouraged recklessness, ever bigger bubbles and the crash to end all crashes Every share on the FTSE 100 index is now down, as traders hunker down ahead of the Wall Street open in two hours time... James Andrews, head of investment management at City firm Redmayne Bentley, reckons that the global selloff will abate soon. He argues that investors have over-reacted to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump in US wages (which arguably makes rising inflation and higher interest rates more likely). Andrews says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to say the volatility can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t continue, as we have had a phase of very low volatility and some profit taking is natural following a prolonged period of exceptional returns. However, given the positive fundamentals around the globe currently, it feels like any market pull-back should be relatively short in nature at this time until we see a material change in global interest rates, and therefore the return on cash and less risky assets, not to mention a less favourable outlook for companies globally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters latest market update: World stock markets nosedived for a fourth day running on Tuesday, having seen $4 trillion wiped off from what just eight days ago had been record high values. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main bourses were down around 2 percent, leaving investors with little option but to seek traditional refuges such as gold and one of the initial triggers for the selloff - benchmark government bonds. Wall Street futures offered a chink of light as they turned higher in Europe but commodities remained gloomy, with oil and industrial metals all tumbling backwards as the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat start for markets soured rapidly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Playtime is officially over, kids,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd analysts at Rabobank said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rising volatility painfully reminds some investors that one-way bets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets are heading lower as lunchtime approaches, as investors fear another day of losses on Wall Street. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is now down 180 points, or 2.5%, heading close to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one-year low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the futures market is now indicating fresh losses in New York when the market opens (at 2.30pm UK time, or 8.30am on the East Coast). Right now, the S&amp;P 500 index (which covers the major US companies) is predicted to fall 1% - on top of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4% slide. The Dow is also being called lower - it could shed 400 points at the open, following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,175 rout. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says investors will be glued to the Wall Street open, to get their next cue for where global markets are headed. He adds: Futures have been all over the place this morning but seem to be settling lower, ready to push through another run of levels on the downside. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a rough day for traders around the globe, as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s correction has gathered pace. Oh dear. Investors who had bet on low market volatility by putting money into that XIV security have been discussing their losses on Reddit. One claims to have lost $4m, due to the surge in volatility yesterday, while other small traders are nursing smaller, but painful, losses. The Dow Jones futures price has been flailing around since Wall Street closed 14 hours ago: Update: The FTSE 100 is currently down 150 points, or 2%, at 7183 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest level since April 2017, but a recovery on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one-year low (when the FTSE fell 250 points). Nicholas Brooks, Head of Economic and Investment Research at Intermediate Capital Group, says the sell-off seems to be easing off.... for the moment. The equity market corrections of the past few days were overdue and not unexpected. The sell-off appears to be abating at the moment, with US government yields having dropped back to pre-correction levels and market indices and futures bouncing, but changes in market positioning and technicals make short-term predictions of market direction particularly difficult. Volatility in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets has soared in recent days, bringing a long period of calm to an abrupt end. The CBOE VIX index, commonly known as the Wall Street \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, has jumped by 14% this morning to 42.62, a gain of 5.3 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since August 2015 (when worries over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy rocked the markets). Yesterday the VIX more than doubled, as shares slumped in London, New York, and then across Asia. It has only closed higher on three previous occasions. This surge in volatility is bad news for speculators who had wagered that markets would remain calm. But how would you place such a bet?.... Well, Credit Suisse has the answer. It offers a financial product called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inverse VIX\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which rises when volatility falls -- and allows traders to profit from calm markets. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama has sparked fears that some hedge funds will be sitting on heavy losses on their XIV holdings, which they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to unravel. Credit Suisse has said this morning that it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t incurred any trading losses on its inverse VIX product. But surely someone has lost money? After all, the XIV fell heavily in after-hours trading. CNBC has more details. Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, says the stock markets love affair with Donald Trump is over. Rather than revelling in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts, investors are now focusing on the inflationary impact, and the likely surge in government borrowing to cover the shortfall in revenue. He writes: We are seeing the biggest correction for well over a year on the stock markets but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to call this a crash. In the last few years indices followed a strong bullish trend and so far, this is nothing more than a physiological correction. The violence of the fall seen in the US on Friday and Monday has to be kept in the context of the huge growth of Dow Jones and Wall Street in the last few years. For Trump however, the long honeymoon between him and the stock markets is well and truly over. Significantly, after years of low inflation, we are now talking about the opposite scenario for the US. Eek. The futures market is now indicating that the Dow Jones industrial average will fall further when trading resumes, in under four hours. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days (many New York traders will still be asleep), but a sign that Wall Street is somewhat feverish after the biggest daily fall since 2011. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, warns that there could be more turmoil ahead: Stock markets are still squarely in the red this morning even though we are seeing a recovery. After another horrendous session in New York last night and Asia overnight equity markets in Europe are feeling the pain. The sheers size of the sell-offs has sent traders running for the exit. This morning there is some short covering and bargain going on, but the real acid test will be if this short-term move higher can be sustained. Markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move in straight lines so this could be the calm before the next storm. A top central banker has called on international authorities to rein in bitcoin. Agusti\u00cc\ufffdn Carstens, the new head of the Bank for International Settlements, warned this morning that bitcoin had become a combination of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: Time for a quick recap. European stock markets have suffered sharp losses this morning after Wall Street was routed last night. But markets are clawing their way back from their worst levels, as investors cross their fingers and hope that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re experiencing a correction, not a full-blown crash. After two hours trading, the FTSE 100 is down 146 points - or 2% - at 7189. It had earlier hit a one-year low, by shedding 255 points at the open. The Footsie has now fallen by around 6.3% this year, and shed all 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Across Europe, traders have been selling hard - after the shock of seeing the Dow Jones industrial average tumble by 1,175 points on Monday, its biggest points fall ever (but a more modest percentage decline of 4.6%). The benchmark Stoxx 600 is down 1.6%, with heavier losses in Germany (-1.9%). European markets had initially plunged by 3%, their biggest fall since the Brexit vote, after a day of heavy losses in Asia. But shares are rebounding off their worst levels, thanks to indications that Wall Street may open higher. Several analysts are suggesting that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls are a correction, following frothy rises during 2017. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says: Whilst there was no single event which prompted Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell off, fears over rising interest rates dampening economic growth and the fact that the market is long due a correction, have been weighing on sentiment. The first signs falling confidence and investors have been surprisingly quick to sell out and book profits from the phenomenal rally over the past few months. Asian investors have already suffered a bad day, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei sliding into correction territory (10% below its peak), the Hong Kong Hang Seng down 5%, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main markets down around 3%, and India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sensex down 1.5%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off is a great chance to buy stocks, says Michael Strobaek, Global CIO at Credit Suisse. Strobaek is telling his clients that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off is not a crash, and actually an opportunity to snap up shares. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his reasoning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We still consider the equity bull market to be intact and to have the potential to go further. Yet, as we have said on numerous occasions, the bull market is not going to be as good as what we saw in 2017, and it will be associated with high levels of volatility, as short rates and now yields have left their bottoms and are moving higher.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Recent risk-off moves in equities do not shake our equities conviction. We see the latest developments as a healthy correction that offers a buying opportunity for clients who wish to deploy cash.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just 12 days ago, US president Donald Trump was bragging to the World Economic Forum that the markets were up 50% on his watch (a slight exaggeration). He even claimed that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d actually have fallen 50% if the Democrats had won the 2016 election, as he banged the drum for his tax cuts. However, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trip to Davos may mark the top of the rally. As this charts shows, the Dow has fallen by around 8% since his trip to the ski resort: Disappointingly, Trump hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commented about the markets recently. The FT has called him out for this today, pointing out that he tweeted 60 times during the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge of record highs in 2017. The boss of oil giant BP, Bob Dudley, is relieved that the FTSE is only at a one-year low. Breaking away from the markets briefly. Over at Parliament,former Carillion executives are being grilled over the collapse of the outsourcing company last month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here. My colleague Rob Davies is watching. He reports that Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ex-boss is blaming certain clients for its demise, but MPs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed.... Paul McNamara, investment director at asset management firm GAM, reports that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rough morning - especially for any trader trying to persuade clients to bet that the markets will be calm: Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, says the recent phase of unnatural calm in the markets is definitely over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The low volatility regime is likely dead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2017 and early 2018 were a crazy anomaly. So far the blow up is scary but has been relatively contained. This is the largest two-day selloff since the flash crash of August 2015. A 12% top-to-bottom move in S&amp;P 500 futures is likely the product of a chain reaction that started last Friday when unexpectedly strong US wage growth figures pushed US rates higher. S&amp;P 500 futures are now up 2.6% from their lows.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform, Infinox, argues that the sell off is actually healthy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the fall in global equity markets looks dramatic, it is no more dramatic than the record rises we have seen since the end of November. For that reason alone many would argue a correction was on the cards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The party may be over for now but this could be more of a sobering correction than a rout. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There have been plenty of warnings over the past few weeks that equities were overvalued and that US stock markets in particular were overheating. The Dow Jones industrial average is now predicted to rise by 137 points later today. That would barely make an impact on Mondays 1,175-point rout, but could calm fears that a crash is brewing.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a glimmer of good news -- the futures market is suggesting that the US stock market may open higher after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. The S&amp;P Futures contract is currently up around 0.8%, indicating that American shares will claw back some of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump (when the S&amp;P 500 shed 4.1%). Wall Street doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open for five hours, though, so the situation could change. After one hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, European stock markets are a sea of red - although they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming back from their worst levels. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, points out that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has underperformed Wall Street over the last year - even before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. He writes: The recent falls in the Dow Jones has left the index down 1.5% in the year to date \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but over the last year, the index remains in positive territory to the tune of 21%. In terms of the UK, rather more apples have fallen as the tree has been shaken. Over the last year the index is completely flat, whilst in the year to date it has fallen 6.4%. The previous benefit of weaker sterling has evaporated, and whilst participation in the previous rally was somewhat half-hearted, the same cannot be said of the UK market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to the current jitters. Gemma Godfrey, founder of investment site Moola, also blames last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong US jobs data for sparking a bloodbath in stocks. This is one of the roughest mornings for the markets in 18 months: The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more medium-sized UK firms, is also suffering big losses today. The FTSE 250 is down over 2%, with almost every member falling. Transport firm Stagecoach is the biggest faller, down almost 9% after losing its franchise to run Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s East Coast rail franchise. Online grocer Ocado has shed 7% after missing its profit expectations this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that the stock markets posted some astonishing gains last year, with global stocks gaining 22% and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 up 7.6%.. Economics journalist Dharshini David says the markets are now coming back to earth: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the sell-off is being driven by a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. They include: A strong 2017 rally extending into January, low volatility, low interest rates, over-optimism and complacency, over-leverage and financial engineering, all coming to a head as investors react to the possibility of higher/faster interest rates rises with bond yields creeping higher to jeopardise the current market situation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always hard to explain exactly why the financial markets are behaving in a certain way. But many City experts are attributing the sell-off to fears that central banks will soon raise interest rates, ending the era of cheap money. Last Friday, we learned that American workers have enjoyed the biggest jump in earnings since 2009. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great news - except it could force the US central bank to hike borrowing costs more aggressively. Investors are now factoring in four American interest rate hikes this year - up from three before. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting that markets surged in 2017, thanks to optimism over the global economy. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts gave shares another lift -- because cutting corporation tax is good for profits. But.. those same tax cuts could force America to borrow more money to cover its budget deficit. That would probably push down the value of US government debt, and push up the interest rate (or yield) on those bonds. Again, that could force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. It could also make bonds a more attractive investment - another reason to ditch shares today.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: European stocks have fallen to their lowest level since last August, as traders hit the sell button at bourses across the continent. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies, has fallen by 3.1% this morning. Germany is having a particularly bad morning, down over 3.5%. The London stock market is still deep in the red, but might be bouncing off its opening slump. The FTSE 100 has now lost 7% of its value so far this year, despite hitting a record high in January. Here are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 in early trading: Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index of top shares is tumbling at the start of trading, to its lowest level in a year. The FTSE 100 fell by 255 points, or over 3.2%, to 7079 points, with every share losing ground. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been that low since December 2016. Investors are scrambling to sell shares following the tumbles on Wall Street last night, and Asia earlier today. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group tells us: The stock market open in the UK and Europe looks about as bad as it can get. The bloodbath on Wall Street, which was repeated in Asia has seen confidence evaporate in Europe. Hold onto your hats.... the European stock markets are about to open... Cryptocurrencies are also being hammered hard this morning. Bitcoin has tumbled by 12% this morning, taking the digital currency below $6,000 for the first time this year. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says: The most famous digital currency has fallen 69% from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high, and almost 56% from the start of the year. The slide comes after many banks in the U.S. and U.K. considered banning customers from buying cryptocurrencies using their credit cards. It seems the war against the crypto-world is far from over, and how the situation involves from here remains unknown, but risks are certainly high. If you missed last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil (where were you?), here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of how the Dow Jones Industrial Average took an almighty bath: Risk aversion is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the City today as we head towards the start of trading., says Elsa Lignos of RBC Capital Markets. She says RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk aversion thermometer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hit a 2.5 year high of 27 on Monday - the highest level since China stunned the markets by devaluing its currency in 2015. Lignos adds: That time it took six weeks to turn risk-seeking again. Jamie McGeever of Reuters has a sobering fact -- $4 trillion has been wiped off global markets in the last week. That figure could be somewhat higher by the end of the day.... Earlier today Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei fell into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorrection territory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, meaning it has shed more than 10% from its recent high. The sharp losses on global stock markets in recent days may be a sign that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGoldilocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 era is over -- replaced by some aggressive and hungry bears. Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities., explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since last autumn, investors had been betting on the goldilocks economy - solid economic expansion, improving corporate earnings and stable inflation. But the tide seems to have changed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning from London. Financial markets are in turmoil after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stocks suffered their biggest one-day slide in six years. The Dow plunged by over 1,100 points on Monday, its worst points loss ever and the biggest one-day percentage decline since the Eurozone crisis of 2011. This has sent shockwaves through the markets, as investors fear that the long bull market in shares and bonds may be ending. Worries over rising inflation and the prospect of American interest rate rises sparked Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell off. Some traders warning that computer trading strategies has triggered a flash crash (at one stage the Dow was down by a vertiginous 1,500 points). Already today, Asian markets have posted severe losses. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has shed 4.7%, while Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market shed 3.2%. My colleague Claire Phipps has been live-blogging all the action in Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets here: European markets open in under an hour, and traders are already expecting heavy losses. City firm IG are calling Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 down around 3%, with the French, German, Italian and Spanish markets also heading for very sharp falls. Jingyi Pan of IG warns that the markets are febrile today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There would be few places to hide from the risk-off atmosphere that is expected to extend its stay in Asian markets today in a significant manner. This is fear rolling over itself,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says this correction has been a long time coming... These declines have been a long time coming and in a sense have already started to become self-accelerating. At the end of last year margin debt levels on US stocks were at record highs, helping fuel the rise we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the last few months. The sell-off in the last few days is likely to reverse this trend, and potentially accelerate it further, particularly if investors start to unwind it over concerns that we could fall further, which seems likely if events in Asia this morning are any guide. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a volatile situation out there - traders will be looking to see whether Wall Street can recover, or whether it suffers fresh losses. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the action through the day....",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates.

Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,175 points on Monday following another sharp fall last Friday.

Then, we still could easily raise rates another three or even four times in 2018 if that were necessary. And I would support such a faster pace if the data point convincingly in this direction.</p> </blockquote> <p>Evans said he expected US GDP to grow between 2.5% and 2.75% this year, with growth slowing over the next two years as the boost from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts wears off.</p> <p>As for inflation, he expects it to rise gradually over the next few years:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a hint that this may be in train today.

While wage increases have been disappointingly low, the most recent data exhibit a firming trend. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently been hearing from more of my business contacts that firms are raising wages, giving additional bonuses, and boosting benefits. These are all positive signs for wage growth and clear signs of tighter labor markets.</p> <p>In my forecast, I expect inflation to rise gradually to our 2 percent target, perhaps reaching it in late 2019 or in 2020. But despite the indicators I just noted, I have not yet seen many actual increases in consumer prices. So, my forecast of reaching our target is still just a forecast. There is still a role for accommodative monetary policy to bring us back to our 2 percent inflation target.</p> </blockquote> <p>Evans voted against a rate rise in December but is a non-voting member this year, so his comments won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily hold much sway when it comes to the path of interest rates, although his reasoning is interesting.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-07T16:43:14.154Z\">at 4.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a7b256fe4b07556c9fb7646\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-07T16:13:14.869Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The rout in stocks seen in the first two days of the week seems a long way away now, as a classic rebound in sentiment sees the Dow gain over 200 points within the first two hours, while the FTSE 100 continues to claw its way higher.</p> <p>The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash on the sidelines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 theory gets a lot of stick these days, since who in their right mind would still hold cash when the market kept racing higher, but evidently equity investors (or their passive machine counterparts) have managed to scrimmage behind the sofa for some more funds in order to go bargain hunting in stock markets.

                "bodyText":"In another volatile day of trading, US markets ended the day in negative territory after a new rise in bond yields. Yields rose after a disappointing bond auction and reports of a new budget deal which would increase current spending caps. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 19.42 points at 24,893.35. After an earlier rise of 381 points this was its biggest turnaround since August 2015. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 ended down 0.5%. On that note we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close up until tomorrow. After their declines on Tuesday, European markets have taken their cue from the overnight rise on Wall Street and also the opening optimism in the US. The FTSE 100, which saw its biggest losses since the Brexit vote on Tuesday, has recovered more than half of the decline, and there was a similar picture elsewhere. Signs that Germany was putting its political differences aside also helped sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 138.02 points or 1.93% at 7279.42 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 1.6% to 12,590.43 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.82% to 5255.90 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 2.86% better at 22,986.18 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.7% at 9976.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.33% to 849.94 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 132 points or 0.49%, off its best levels after US ten year bond yields rose to a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high of 2.828% in the wake of a disappointing auction. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow (unless something major happens before then). Thanks for reading and all your comments. Meanwhile, Greece is mulling pushing ahead with the sale of a seven-year euro benchmark bond - postponed on account of the sell-off - on Thursday, bankers say. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After years of exile, the debt-stricken county is keen to prove it can tap international markets again. The seven-year issue would be its boldest market foray yet, and was formally announced on Monday with trading expected to take place Tuesday. Instead, Greek finance officials took one look at the market rout and thought better of it. But depending on how the US markets perform, trade could begin Thursday bankers are now saying. Greece hopes to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn with the issue as part of efforts to build up a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19bn cash buffer that would allow the country to cover debt repayments independently when its third international bailout programme officially expires in August. Back with cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin is up 4% to $8,050 despite negative comments from Goldman Sachs. Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at payments specialist Centtrip, said: Bitcoin staged a solid recovery today, having previously fallen 70% from its record highs last December. The cryptocurrency briefly dropped below the $6,000 a coin level before gaining almost 40%, and is now back above $8,000 a coin. The rise comes at a time when Goldman...suggested market participants should be ready for cryptocurrencies to hit zero. According to the bank, the fall in cryptocurrencies, which erased nearly $500 billion worth of market value over the last month, could get a lot worse. Nouriel Roubini, an American economist, suggested that bitcoin was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmuch worse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than Tulipmania. His comments had zero impact on the recent surge in Bitcoin, suggesting that some of the optimism around cryptocurrencies is still there. A break of $9,500 would signal further gains for the coin, but a longer term move lower is more likely. US interest rates should not rise before the middle of the year, according to Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans. With the recent strong data - notably Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth - analysts have been becoming more convinced a rate rise is on the cards in March, with four rather than three rises in the rest of the year. But speaking at a conference in Iowa, Evans said: With the data I see today, my policy strategy would be to keep policy on hold until midyear or so in order to assess the incoming inflation data. If we get to that point and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted. In contrast, suppose inflation picks up more assuredly, as many expect. Then, we still could easily raise rates another three or even four times in 2018 if that were necessary. And I would support such a faster pace if the data point convincingly in this direction. Evans said he expected US GDP to grow between 2.5% and 2.75% this year, with growth slowing over the next two years as the boost from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts wears off. As for inflation, he expects it to rise gradually over the next few years: There is a hint that this may be in train today. Some inflation indicators over the past couple of months have been positive. I also am hearing a bit more commentary from manufacturers about higher commodity prices. While wage increases have been disappointingly low, the most recent data exhibit a firming trend. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently been hearing from more of my business contacts that firms are raising wages, giving additional bonuses, and boosting benefits. These are all positive signs for wage growth and clear signs of tighter labor markets. In my forecast, I expect inflation to rise gradually to our 2 percent target, perhaps reaching it in late 2019 or in 2020. But despite the indicators I just noted, I have not yet seen many actual increases in consumer prices. So, my forecast of reaching our target is still just a forecast. There is still a role for accommodative monetary policy to bring us back to our 2 percent inflation target. Evans voted against a rate rise in December but is a non-voting member this year, so his comments won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily hold much sway when it comes to the path of interest rates, although his reasoning is interesting. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The rout in stocks seen in the first two days of the week seems a long way away now, as a classic rebound in sentiment sees the Dow gain over 200 points within the first two hours, while the FTSE 100 continues to claw its way higher. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash on the sidelines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 theory gets a lot of stick these days, since who in their right mind would still hold cash when the market kept racing higher, but evidently equity investors (or their passive machine counterparts) have managed to scrimmage behind the sofa for some more funds in order to go bargain hunting in stock markets. While we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell what will happen next, the current course of events has mirrored previous market selloffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c brief panic, steady recovery and then a return to the longer-term rally. It is, after all, a bull market. The rebound in markets continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 311 points or 1.28%, while the FTSE 100 is 2.26% better, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 1.8% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 1.89%. Oil prices have come under pressure amid a rise in US crude stocks and a jump in US production. Opec and Russia have agreed output cuts to try and support crude prices, but there were concerns that US producers would step in to fill any shortfalls as the price rose. Last week the Energy Information Administration reported that US production rose by 332,000 barrels a day to a record high of 10.25m barrels a day. Meanwhile crude inventories rose by 1.9m barrels last week. Brent fell more than 0.8% on the news to $66.18, giving up all the gains made so far this year. The news from the US offset reports that the UK Forties pipeline was shut with no clear indication of when it would re-open. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest comments on the stock market. Dominic Rushe writes: The stock market is making a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Donald Trump said on Thursday, days after a record-breaking sell-off on the US exchanges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcold days,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump wrote on Twitter in his first public comment on the sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,175 points on Monday following another sharp fall last Friday. The drop appears to have been triggered by news of stronger than expected growth in wages which fueled expectations of a sharper rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Commenting on the markets on Tuesday White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the US economy was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Since his election Trump US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and global \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stock markets have hit a series of record highs. Trump has consistently pointed to rising stock markets as proof that his economic policies are working. The full report is here: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boasting about the rise in the US stock market came shortly before the crash, and he has been notably silent about it since then. Until now that is: The bounce on Wall Street has given an extra lift to European markets. The FTSE 100 is now up 105 points or 1.5%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has risen 0.9% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.8%. As a sign we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in for another volatile day, the Dow is now up 97 points. After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rollercoaster ride in US markets which ended with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 567 points and the S&amp;P 500 breaking a four day losing streak, Wall Street is heading lower again. As politicians scramble to put together a two year Budget plan that would prevent another government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down around 111 points but the decline was quickly reduced to just 29 points. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq Composite both opened down 0.32%. Ahead of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open, Federal Reserve voting member William Dudley says he believes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the markets are functioning quite well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But he also said: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is expected to show robust growth this year and next after a better than forecast performance in 2017, according to the European Commission. In its latest forecasts the Commission said both the eurozone and the wider EU saw GDP grow by 2.4% last year, better than the 2.2% and 2.3% respectively that it predicted in November. For 2018 the Commission expects a slowdown to 2.3%, although this is higher than the 2.1% it forecast in November. It is forecasting a further decline to 2% in 2019, but again this is higher than the November estimate of 1.9%. It said: This is a result of both stronger cyclical momentum in Europe, where labour markets continue to improve and economic sentiment is particularly high, and a stronger than expected pick-up in global economic activity and trade. On inflation it expected a modest pick-up next year: Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, is expected to stay subdued as labour market slack recedes only slowly and wage pressures remain contained. Headline inflation will continue to reflect the significant influence of energy prices and is forecast to rise modestly. Inflation in the euro area reached 1.5% in 2017. It is forecast to remain at 1.5% in 2018 and to increase to 1.6% in 2019. And more positivity about the markets for 2018, this time from Goldman Sachs: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bit of context for the recent market falls: James Swanson, Chief Investment Strategist at asset manager MFS, is also in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorrection not a crash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 crew. He argues that the economics fundamentals are solid, so shares shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep plunging. Conditions don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be in place for a prolonged market downturn. Corporate balance sheets remain strong, while fourth-quarter earnings have surpassed expectations. Additionally, the credit markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t signaling that a major shift in risk appetite has taken place. High-yield bond spreads have widened, but only marginally, from historically tight levels. Recent yield increases in non-investment-grade bonds have been driven more by rising Treasury rates than by growing credit concerns. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a source of comfort for equity investors. In just over an hour, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll discover if Wall Street agrees... London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is creeping higher, helping the FTSE 100 recover from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-month low. The Footsie is now at its daily high, up 80 points or 1.1%. That shows that some confidence has returned to the City. However, it still leaves shares down 6% so far this year. Financial stocks are leading the rally, with energy stocks and utilities also in demand. City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta remains cautious, though: Whilst we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this sell off to continue for an extended period of time, given that the fundamentals remain strong and unchanged, it is difficult to call the bottom and judge whether stocks have fallen sufficiently for investors to see value once again. After days of falls, Bitcoin is staging a rally today. The digital currency has bounced back up to $8,200, having hit a near-three month low below $6,000 on Tuesday. Bitcoin has been under pressure from regulators and politicians in recent weeks, keen to crack down on the use of digital currencies for money-laundering and reckless speculation. But Nigel Brahams, partner at London law firm Collyer Bristow, argues that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t write bitcoin off: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current situation is like the dot com boom and bust in the late 1990s, when cynics who couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face up to a changing world wrote off new online businesses too readily. The weak businesses and valueless coins will fail, but the really good projects like Ethereum and Bitcoin are here to stay, much like Amazon 20 years ago.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average is being called down 1%, when trading begins in three-and-a-half hour. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less fear in the markets today, but volatility remains high, says Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades. It is curious considering the fact that for years we were fighting against low inflation or even deflation and now this correction is generated by growing expectations of inflation in the US. American stock indices lead the recovery in the last few year and now they spread the uncertainty around the world. Investors who had wagered that the markets would remain calm have been burned by this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil. For example, those who bought a security from Japanese bank Nomura, which moved inversely to market volatility, have lost almost all their money. Bloomberg explains: Nomura Holdings Inc. issued an apology after investors in a $300 million product betting on low volatility were all but wiped out during this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market turmoil. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest brokerage said Wednesday that it has received inquiries from individual investors after its decision to redeem the exchange-traded notes at a 96 percent discount. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We sincerely apologize for causing significant difficulties to investors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its Nomura Europe Finance unit said in a statement a day earlier. Nomura\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Next Notes S&amp;P500 VIX Short-Term Futures Inverse Daily Excess Return Index ETN involved a bet against stock-market gyrations by moving in the opposite direction to a gauge of volatility. Its early redemption -- the first of its kind in Japan -- was triggered after the notes lost more than 80 percent of their value amid the global equity-market selloff. The bulls still have the upper hand over the bears on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floors today. After two hours trading, the main indices are all up, as investors hold their nerve. The FTSE 100 has dipped back a little, up 35 points at 7179. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is up 0.6%, while the Italian FTSE MIB has gained 0.9%. Shares may have found some support after recent losses, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a strong recovery. Analysts at FX Pro reckon investors are using the turmoil as a cautious buying opportunity: It may still be too early to talk about a return to growth or to celebrate another fast and easy victory of the bull market. Rather, it seems more likely that panicked selling will give way to more calculated portfolio rebalancing. Reuters have a good explanation for how computerised trading, and bets on low volatility, combined to cause this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem: It was a steep spike in yields last Friday that sparked the initial rout on Wall Street, forcing sales by a host of highly leveraged funds, which ramped up volatility and drove yet more selling. Many of these were algorithmic funds crowded into similar trades - long stocks and short volatility. The selling then cascaded through their computer systems in a way almost beyond human intervention. The pivotal gauge of S&amp;P 500 volatility, the VIX , did come off almost 20 points overnight but was still relatively elevated at 29.98 percent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Short volatility funds were caught by the spike in the VIX and had to cover,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a genius until you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not and when it takes just a day or two to unwind your whole strategy then you were never a genius,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But volatility does cluster, so there is no guarantee that markets are out of the woods yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Important news out of Berlin. Angela Merkel has reportedly reached a deal with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Social Democrats to create a new grand coalition. After overnight talks, the CDU/CSU and the SPD have broken the deadlock and hammered out a deal that - in principle - would return Merkel as chancellor, according to media reports from Germany. But... the SPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members still have to approve the plan. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll vote in the next few weeks. Intriguingly, it appears that the SPD could get control of the German finance ministry, and the foreign ministry. That could have significant impact on the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy -- Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next finance minister might take a less hard-line approach on issues such as debt relief and eurobonds, compared to Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble.... NEWSFLASH: UK house prices fell in January, according to the latest survey from Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices declined by 0.6% in the three months to January, following a 0.8% fall a month earlier. That takes the annual house price inflation rate down to 2.2%, compared with 2.7% in December. Halifax also found that fewer new homes are coming onto the market: New instructions to sell continued to deteriorate at the headline level and have now fallen for 23 consecutive months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the worst sequence for almost eight years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally means European stock markets are bucking a seven-day losing streak. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the turbulence is over. Many of the factors blamed for the sell off -- such as fears of US interest rate hikes -- are still in place. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities research team explains: Investors seem to believe that the worst is over and that the sell-off was just a market tantrum that happens a couple of times a year but we tend to believe that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more to come. As discussed above, the key catalysts behind the retreat in the equities markets have to do with the new reality in bond yields, concerns about a tighter Fed policy and doubts over the effectiveness of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms. It was quite a mixed day in Asia, by the end, as the initial optimism from Wall Street faded: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up across Europe, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not.... Supermarket chain Tesco isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t joining the rally, though. Its shares are down 1%, after shopworkers launched an equal pay claim that could prove very expensive. My colleague Sarah Butler has the story: Tesco is facing a demand for up to \u00c2\u00a34bn in back pay from thousands of mainly female shopworkers in what could become the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest ever equal pay claim. A law firm has launched legal action on behalf of nearly 100 shop assistants who say they earn as much as \u00c2\u00a33 an hour less than male warehouse workers in similar roles. Up to 200,000 shopfloor staff could be affected by the claim, which could cost Tesco up to \u00c2\u00a320,000 per worker in back pay over at least six years. Tesco warehouse staff earn from about \u00c2\u00a38.50 an hour up to more than \u00c2\u00a311 an hour while store staff earn about \u00c2\u00a38 an hour in basic pay, according to the claim. The disparity could mean a full-time distribution worker earning over \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year more than store-based staff. Markets are rising across Europe, as a degree of calm returns to trading floors. The Stoxx 600 index is up 0.7% - a modest, rather than spectacular recovery. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, says: Just as markets cannot keep rising forever, they must also stop falling at some point, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still unclear whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reached a level where buyers see value again. Futures prices had indicated a much brighter start for global markets, but early gains were wiped out in Asia and Europe looks vulnerable. Volatility is back, and investors had better get used to it. Shares are rising in London at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is up 65 points, or 0.9%, to 7205, as investors join the rally that began on Wall Street late last night. Pest control firm Rentokil is leading the risers, up 4.3%, followed by packaging firm Smurfit Kappa (+3.5%). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small rebound, compared to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.6% tumble. Mike van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets says traders can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decide whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical correction, or the opening sequence for a greater unwind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An unwind from a protracted period of historically low volatility, yields, borrowing costs and investor concern, which contributed to high levels of market valuation, passive investing, financial engineering and complacency. As the last few days have shown us, things are always \u00e2\u20ac\u0153different this time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, until of course, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not. Royal Bank of Canada is concerned that the early rally in Asia fizzled out as today wore on. US equities recovered some ground in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session after the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record losses. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 1.74% having lost over 4% the day before. The resurgence in volatility saw the VIX index hit an intraday high of over 50, a level not reached since 2015, having barely exceeded 15 for much of last year. Although Asian stock markets initially opened much higher on the back of the rebound in the US, that performance has faded. For example the Nikkei having been up as much as 3.4% on the day at one point is back to almost flat. Similarly, futures on US equity indices are sliding with the Dow off around 1% at the time of writing suggesting the sustainability of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound in sentiment isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assured at this stage. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European markets are rebounding this after two days of wild swings, but investors are still nervous. European stocks are tipped to bounce by at least 1% today, recovering some of Monday and Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp losses. That following a surprise late rally on Wall Street last night that saw the Dow jump by 567 points -- its biggest gain since Donald Trump was elected US president. Over in Asia, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has crept higher over night, but there were further losses in China. City traders are calling the FTSE 100 up 60 points today. That should please shareholders, until they remember that the blue-chip index shed almost 200 points on Tuesday, hitting a 10-month low. The other main European markets are expected to recover today as well. And worryingly, the futures market is suggesting that US stocks could fall back later today. So, it could be another volatile day.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 8.30am GMT: Halifax house price survey 1.30pm GMT: New York Federal Reserve chief William Dudley speaks at an event on Banking Culture in New York. 3.30pm GMT: The weekly US crude oil inventory figures",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Chris Weston, chief market strategist at the online trader IG in Melbourne, said volatility was the main problem.</p> \n<p>He said the Vix volatility index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear index\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had spiked sharply this year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and that means there is no confidence about going out and filling your boots with stocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You could wake up and the Dow is down another 1,000 points, or it could be up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weston said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no certainty.

However, this week Bill Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, dismissed the stock market sell-off as being of little consequence to central bankers. Meanwhile Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told the Financial Times that market volatility could be healthy and that he was sticking with his forecast of three rate hikes in 2018. So, the implication is that it would take a lot more than a doubling of volatility and a 1,000-point sell-off to throw the Fed off its current path of monetary tightening. </p> <p>Anyway, what if the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary tightening in the form of rate increases and balance sheet reduction is going to happen anyway, no matter what the inflation and growth outlook? What if the Fed is thinking ahead to the next recession and is desperate to build up ammunition for when it must slash rates again in response? Also, this market was already selling off on the back of rising bond yields before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. In the space of a month the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note had risen from below 2.5% to close to 2.9%. While this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off in equities saw yields drop back sharply as investors sought out safety of US Treasuries, the 10-year yield is once again approaching 2.9% and giving every indication the new key level of 3.0% is about to be tested. If so, then we can expect global equities to take another hit as investors panic about the prospect of higher rates on highly leveraged and over-indebted markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7c7d82e4b05abd28aabd7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T16:41:14.334Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One Wall Street economist points to the earlier US jobless claims as a reason for the Wall Street slide:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/status/961639300327763968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Catalyst for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell off?

Policymakers also said they will try and bring inflation back to their 2% target more quickly than previously, which means rates could rise faster and further than investors had expected. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric echoed that of September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting minutes, which preceded the November rate hike.</p> <p>It now looks like the next rise could happen as soon as May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the next time the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic forecasts are due to be updated.

Global inflationary pressures had also shown signs of building. The tightness of the domestic labour market could result in faster wage and unit labour cost growth. The predicted pickup in productivity growth was not assured.</p> <p><strong>On the downside, some business survey indicators of output had weakened</strong>. Recent housing and retail sales data had softened and, more generally, consumers might still respond to the past squeeze in real incomes to a greater degree than anticipated.</p> <p>And UK net trade could benefit by less from the pickup in global demand than had been the case recently.

                "bodyText":"Just when you thought it was safe to go back ... the selling is back. Investors in Asia were spooked after a big drop in the Dow Heavy losses across Asia Pacific, notably in Tokyo and Shanghai FTSE100 set open down 0.24%; the Dax in Germany up 0.2% Weak inflation numbers and overseas selling heaped pressure on Chinese bourses The Vix fear index hit 33.46, creating \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for traders Veteran US investor Jim Rogers says the next bear market will be the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworst ever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Sentiment also crimped by another US government shutdown Those numbers in full: Nikkei 225: DOWN 2.32% (close) Hang Seng: DOWN 3.2% ASX200, Sydney: DOWN 0.91% (close) Shanghai Composite: DOWN 4.1% (close) Kospi, South Korea: DOWN 1.82% (close) FTSE100: DOWN 1.5% at 7,170.69 (close) Dow Jones: DOWN 4.2% at 23,860.46 (close) S&amp;P 500: DOWN 3.8% at 2,581.00 (close) Nasdaq: DOWN 3.9% at 6,777.16 (close) Pound/dollar: UP at $1.394 from $1.3912 Brent crude: DOWN 46 cents at $64.35 per barrel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m off now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thanks for joining me for the day. My colleague in London, Nick Fletcher, has started a new blog here, so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to miss any of the action as European markets grind into gear. The Chinese market has had one of its worst days for two years. the leading Shanghai Composite index has fallen 4.1%. At one point it was down nearly 6%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off coincided with lower than expected inflation numbers, suggesting that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest economy is slowing down after a strong 2017. Sentiments mentioned earlier about volatility are echoed by another market watcher, David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares Capital in Sydney. He said the markets were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skittish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said the Bank of England governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on Thursday that rates might have to rise again may have influenced Wall Street, however unusual that situation might be. David says: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing is that the overnight sell-off came off the back of relatively little new fundamental news, and highlights the continued skittishness of market sentiment and hyped up concern with regard to bond yields. Indeed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not often the Wall Street sells off 4% due to an apparent tightening bias announced by the Bank of England! As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said, China has been hit hard for the first time in this sell-off. Analysts have been discussing why this might have happened. Yang Weixiao, an analyst with Founder Securities, told Reuters that it was possible foreign investors were having an impact for the first time by selling up in the wake of the broader global dumping. The Shanghai Composite could drop another 15-16% to 2,600 points from its current mark at around 3,100. Yang says: We could see impact from the foreign participation that has become a more significant force in the A-share market, as a global selloff could prompt foreign investors to dump stocks in China. Investors will be very cautious for the moment, and we expect the Shanghai index to drop to 3,000 points, or even further to 2,600 points. Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale in Hong Kong, said Chinese shares slid mostly because of the US correction but he had some China-specific worries. He said he now is neutral on China equities \u00e2\u20ac\u0153due to two concerns: valuations on China-consumer related industries and execution risks on deleveraging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daniel again on the Tokyo close: Here in Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index has finished trading for the day. It closed down 2.32% at 21,382.62 points. That marks a slight improvement from morning trade when it had sunk as low as 3.5%. For a full wrap of the overnight events, my colleague in Tokyo, Daniel Hurst, has just filed this story: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just waking up in Europe here is a ready reckoner on the overnight market moves. There has been a big sell-off in Asia, with the Chinese mainland hit the hardest. The Shanghai Composite index is down nearly 5%. The Nikkei in Tokyo is off 3%. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark ASX200 index closed down 0.91%. The FTSE100 is seen opening down around 0.5% while the pound has risen slightly against the US dollar. Veteran US investor Jim Rogers thinks the next bear market will be worst he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever seen Nikkei 225: DOWN 2.95% Hang Seng: DOWN 3.3% ASX200, Sydney: DOWN 0.91% (close) Shanghai Composite: DOWN 4.93% Kospi, South Korea: DOWN 1.82% FTSE100: DOWN 1.5% at 7,170.69 (close) Dow Jones: DOWN 4.2% at 23,860.46 (close) New York - S&amp;P 500: DOWN 3.8% at 2,581.00 (close) New York - Nasdaq: DOWN 3.9% at 6,777.16 (close) Pound/dollar: UP at $1.394 from $1.3912 Oil - Brent: DOWN 46 cents at $64.35 per barrel It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stumps on the Australian market where the AsX200 has lost 0.91%, or 53.7 points to stand at 5,837 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around $20bn in value. Chris Weston, chief market strategist at the online trader IG in Melbourne, says volatility is the enemy in the markets at the moment. The Vix volatility index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear index\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has spiked sharply this year and created uncertainty loathed by investors. Chris told the blog: The Vix volatility index is trading above 30% and that means there is no confidence about going out and filling your boots with stocks. You could wake up and the Dow is down another 1,000 points, or it could be up. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no certainty. Markets like certainty but the only certainty at the minute is of a big move but that could be up or down. The fiasco that is the US federal budget process has produced another government shutdown. Funding for the government machine will lapse at midnight US eastern time tonight (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in about 25 minutes) after Republican Senator Rand Paul stalled a key vote. Read the full story here: Having said that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get carried away, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just get carried away again. Jim Rogers, the veteran US stock picker, reckons that the next bear market will be the worst he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever known. The reason he feels so pessimistic is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much debt around. While a lot of experts talk up the strong fundamentals in the global economy, he says a lot of the upside has been built on debt. He told Bloomberg: When we have a bear market again, and we are going to have a bear market again, it will be the worst in our lifetime. Debt is everywhere, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much, much higher now. He thinks the selling will go on until the Fed raises rates in March. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very bad in market timing. But maybe there will be continued sloppiness until March when they raise interest rates, and it looks like the market will rally. Things have eased slightly since this tweet. For example, the Shanghai Comp is now off only 4.11%. But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to love the redness. Before we get carried away with doom and gloom, this chart from Commsec is quite good. It shows the trajectory of US and Australian stocks since Trump was elected. Indexed to 100 from November 2016, you can see that the Dow Jones had added almost 50% in the 14 months or so up to last week. That is an enormous rise, so even if the current spate of selling continues there is still clearly a lot of froth to wipe off the top, as it were. There are quite a few theories about what has sparked the latest selling. We know that last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong US jobs and wages figures strengthened the feeling that inflation was on the up and that interest rate rises would not be far behind. That had been prefigured, it must be said, by the weeks-long rise in US bond yields which pointed to higher long-term rates. This is a good roundup on those factors. However, there are also human factors at large. Earlier today Craig James, chief economist at Commsec in Sydney, told ABC radio that profit-taking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where investors see the dip and think that they may as well cash in some recent gains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was one reason for the renewed selling. Doug Cote, meanwhile, who is chief market strategist at the US firm Voya Investment Management, told Bloomberg News that some traders had been caught out by the prospect of up to four rate hikes by the US Federal reserve this year. He even used the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153p\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd word. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some big-money players that have really leveraged to the low rates forever, and they have to unwind those trades. They could be in full panic mode right now. The sell-off is intensifying around Asia. The Nikkei closed for the lunch break down 3.22%, or more than 700 points. But the biggest hit is in China where the Shanghai Compsoite has taken a real battering, losing 5.6% so far. The biggest comapnies have suffered most. The Hang Seng is off 4.25% and Seoul 2.16%. Back to Australia. Earlier we heard from Michael McCarthy at CMC markets who said that traders wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay much heed to local data today and would instead be driven by the moves on Wall Street. I think we can assume, though, that the local news would not have had an upward effect on the markets either as mortgage approvals missed expectations by quite a long chalk. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the number of home loan approvals for owner occupiers fell 2.3% in December, short of forecasts for a decline of 1.0%. The value of total housing finance also fell by 1.6 per cent to $32.88bn. The value of new mortgages for owner-occupiers was down 1.0% compared with November, while investor loans were off 2.6%. Time for roundup of the stock market moves in Asia Pacific today: Nikkei - DOWN 2.64% ASX200 - DOWN 1.16% Kospi (Seoul) - DOWN 1.58% Hang Seng - DOWN 2.64% Shanghai Composite - DOWN 2.68% Talking of China, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard much from there during this mini-market meltdown. Back in the northern summer of 2015 a devaluation of the yuan triggered all sorts of mayhem on global markets. You might remember it. Things are much calmer on that front and in fact the yuan has been moving steadily upwards ever since that crisis eventually cooled in January 2016. Back then, investors were having kittens as the yuan hit nearly 7 to the US dollar and the talk was of currency manipulation to make Chinese exports cheaper. A certain US presidential candidate made a lot of the issue. The yuan has since appreciated to 6.3, confounding Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric, but yesterday it actually had its biggest one-day fall since August 2015. Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note earlier today that the drop possibly reflects discomfort in Beijing about the continued strength of the currency. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank has ways of influencing the unit,including capital controls and using the state press to talk it down a bit. As Mark wryly observes at the end of his note: In the eyes of the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank, this is all consistent with the longstanding aim of allowing the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value to reflect market fundamentals. Policymakers just reserve the right to decide what those fundamentals are. The sell-off in Asia is continuing in Hong Kong where the market opened a few minutes ago. The Shanghai Composite is down even more with a drop of 2.7%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 2.5%, taking it below 30,000 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some heavyweight commentary from Mohammed El-Erian, the man who once controlled the $2 trillion assets of Pimco, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bond trader. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got advice about the markets in two helpful stages, which goes roughly like this: 1) don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic, and 2) seriously folks, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic. And secondly: As Michael McCarthy notes below, the Aussie has slipped a bit in the last few hours as more cautious investors sought the safe haven of the US dollar and commodity prices were under pressure. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sitting at a six-week low of US78c this lunchtime having dropped to US0.77.83 earlier. Westpac\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Imre Speizer says the Australian dollar was among the worst performing currencies in the offshore session. Defensive currencies and the British pound were the best performers on the day, the AUD and NZD the worst. The USD was resilient, perhaps displaying its defensive qualities, (with) the US dollar index up 0.1 per cent on the day. Ah yes, the pound. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on $1.39 at the moment. Losses on the Australian market have eased slightly since the 10am open. The ASX200 is now off 1.5%, or 87.4 points, at 5,801.7. Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, in Sydney, says that the markets have returned to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary volatility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the re-pricing of assets resumed in the light of concerns about possible higher interest rates in the US. It leaves Asia Pacific investors facing a torrid trading today. Ten year bond yields in the US, Germany, the UK and many other countries are at multi-year highs as nascent inflation emerges in key economies. In accelerating declines US indices shed 4% last night, the sum of the previous week. Ironically investors favoured the more certain earnings streams of utilities and property stocks despite their obvious sensitivity to rising interest rates. The contradictory investment logic indicates markets have much to resolve and volatility will continue to bite. A stronger US dollar weighed on commodity markets. Commodity currencies like the Aussie dollar fell with oil, copper and gold. However the safe haven status of the Japanese yen attracted buyers and it was the most sought currency overnight. The strong relationship between USD/JPY and the Nikkei index could see more value destruction in Tokyo than other regional centres. Corporate results and Australian home lending data are unlikely to shape trading, despite the high relevance to financial stocks. Traders will instead monitor the out of hours trading of US futures markets to calibrate their responses. Ouch. And in case you missed the earlier action on Wall Street here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart that tells the story of the official correction in the market. Good morning Asia Pacific market watchers! This Martin Farrer in Sydney taking over from the blogtastic Graeme Wearden. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a busy day and night in the world of finance but now all eyes are on the markets in this time zone. As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a rough start in Australia and Japan. But take heed, perhaps, of a point by respected AMP economist Shane Oliver, who says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really no need to panic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corrections of 5-15% are normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Newsflash: Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has opened, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s following Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead downwards. The Nikkei has shed almost 3% to 21,245.50 points. The Topix index is down 2.8%. After today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is on track for its worst week in over two years, reports my colleague Dominic Rushe: Another day of wild swings in the financial markets saw more than 1,000 points wiped off the Dow Jones industrial average \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a loss for the day of over 4%. It was the third drop of more than 500 points for the Dow in the last five days and the Dow is now down 10% from its peak on 26 January, a fall known as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153correction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The more broadly based measure of US share prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the S&amp;P 500 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index were also sharply lower as traders reacted nervously to concerns about rising inflation in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Things haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quietened down. Things are all over the place. The market is trying to find a bottom to this madness,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now we are having acute attention on what happens in the bond markets, so when yields move up there is an unsettling feeling in the equity market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Every sector of the Australian stock market is down this morning: Here are the biggest fallers on the ASX 200: Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit its lowest level in nearly four months. With trading fully underway, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index has shed 1.7%, inflicting fresh losses on shareholders. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down at 5,789 points, the lowest since 12 October 2017: Breaking: Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen by more than 1.5% at the start of trading, following the losses in New York a few hours ago. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 index is down 97 points at 5,793, as the global stock market turmoil enters a new day. New Zealand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market is also under pressure, falling 1.7% at the open. Asian traders are clearly jittery, having heard that the Dow Jones industrial average has now fallen into a correction. Financial spreadbetting firm IG predicts that Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index could tumble by 3% on Friday. It also sees chunky losses in Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, India and China. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market will become the first to react to Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall into a correction, in just 25 minutes. Tension is already building, with shares expected to fall sharply. As well as being 10% off its peak, the Dow is also down almost 3.5% during 2018. But, the benchmark index is still up around 30% since Donald Trump won the US election in November 2016. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, makes an important point over Twitter. During the bull market, shares and bonds both rose. Now in this crash, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both falling: [In a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnormal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect bonds and shares to move inversely - with investors pushing shares up when they felt confident, but rushing into the safety of bonds when they were nervous] The surge in market volatility this week may force speculators who had bet on calm markets to unwind their positions -- potentially driving shares even lower. Bloombeg has a good take: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For a market that hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fallen 3 percent from any high in more than a year, the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action was enough to rattle even the biggest equity bulls. Accustomed to buying the dip, that wisdom is now in question when more selling by speculators may be imminent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some big-money players that have really leveraged to the low rates forever, and they have to unwind those trades,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They could be in full panic mode right now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asia-Pacific stock markets are expected to suffer fresh losses when investors return to work for Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock index, the ASX200, is being called down 1.5% or 82 points, as traders take their cue from the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge into correction territory at the end of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to hopes that the market might be bottoming out - on Thursday, bargain hunters lifted Australian stocks a little. This latest slide on Wall Street shows that markets haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached the bottom of this current correction. Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners in New York, expects further volatility.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dust hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t settled yet, and I think both buyers and sellers are trying to figure out what this market really wants to do. I would think that this continues to happen for the next few trading sessions for everything to kind of get flushed out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how financial types are reacting to the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is now in a correction, after four days of wild swings: Fears over falling government bond prices - and the prospect of higher interest rates - seem to have sparked today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Utah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Albion Financial Group, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are having acute attention on what happens in the bond markets, so when yields move up there is an unsettling feeling in the equity market. Things haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quietened down... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As rates rise, things, as far as equity investors are concerned, are getting worse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters closing market report: US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall St. sinks further in volatile trading as bond yields rise U.S. stocks plunged anew on Thursday in another trading session with big swings, as equities remained in a tug-of-war with bond yields, volatility remained high, and investors saw no relief ahead in finding the bottom of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,032.89 points, or 4.15%, to 23,860.46, the S&amp;P 500 lost 100.58 points, or 3.75%, to 2,581.08 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 274.83 points, or 3.9%, to 6,777.16. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has posted its second-biggest points slump ever. The Dow has closed down around 1,032 points, a fall of over 4%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the second quadruple-point dip this week (and ever). The S&amp;P 500 also suffered another bad day. Reuters is reporting that the S&amp;P and the Dow are now both now in a correction (more than 10% off their peak). Yikes..... the sell off is intensifying, as Wall Street gets the last-minute jitters again.... An Update: A late surge of selling is pushing shares lower on Wall Street. With 10 minuted to go, the Dow is off over 3%, or over 800 points..... It was another day of declines for stock markets, with the falls accelerating as the day progressed. The growing fear of interest rate rises which has spooked investors over the last few days was given additional impetus by the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish tone after its latest meeting and the better than expected weekly US jobless claims. The VIX volatility index was also higher, adding to the downbeat mood. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Stocks are offside today as traders undo the positive move from yesterday. Investors remain unconvinced that panic has disappeared from the markets. The aftermath of a major decline usually leaves traders in limbo as the fear another leg lower is around the corner. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 108.73 points or 1.49% at 7170.69 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 2.62% to 12,260.29 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.98% at 5151.68 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 2.26% to 22,466.60 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 2.21% at 9756.3 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.01% to 841.38 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 570 points or 2.2%. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Adding to the prospects of interest rate rises and thus the market decline - the Dow is off 550 points at the moment - New York Fed president William Dudley has been telling Bloomberg TV that three hikes in 2018 seems reasonable. But: The Dow has now dropped 543 points or just over 2%. It is on track for its worst weekly fall since January 2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 430 points or 1.72%, and if US bond yields continue to rise markets could fall even further, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: The equity market sell-off has spooked investors and led many to speculate that the Fed may decide to pull back from hiking rates aggressively this year. However, this week Bill Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, dismissed the stock market sell-off as being of little consequence to central bankers. Meanwhile Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told the Financial Times that market volatility could be healthy and that he was sticking with his forecast of three rate hikes in 2018. So, the implication is that it would take a lot more than a doubling of volatility and a 1,000-point sell-off to throw the Fed off its current path of monetary tightening. Anyway, what if the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary tightening in the form of rate increases and balance sheet reduction is going to happen anyway, no matter what the inflation and growth outlook? What if the Fed is thinking ahead to the next recession and is desperate to build up ammunition for when it must slash rates again in response? Also, this market was already selling off on the back of rising bond yields before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. In the space of a month the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note had risen from below 2.5% to close to 2.9%. While this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off in equities saw yields drop back sharply as investors sought out safety of US Treasuries, the 10-year yield is once again approaching 2.9% and giving every indication the new key level of 3.0% is about to be tested. If so, then we can expect global equities to take another hit as investors panic about the prospect of higher rates on highly leveraged and over-indebted markets. One Wall Street economist points to the earlier US jobless claims as a reason for the Wall Street slide: The VIX volatility index is also higher, up around 6% at 29.41 although it is still well below the 50 level it reached earlier in the week. Markets continue to be spooked by the prospect of higher interest rates and the removal of the wall of money provided by central banks since the financial crisis. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hawkish tone has only served to reinforce the view that rates are going to continue rising. The market falls are accelerating again. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 220 points or 0.9%. The FTSE 100 has fallen just over 1%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 1% lower. The prospect of a UK rate rise continues to support the pound, which is up just over 1% against the dollar at $1.4030. In turn, the FTSE 100 remains in the red, packed as it is with overseas earners which benefit from a weaker sterling. At the moment it is down more than 1%, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 is 1.2% lower. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said: Both the FTSE 100 and the mid-cap FTSE 250 took Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notice that rates were on the up as negative and traded lower. However, further out, we expect recent evidence of a weakened pound/stocks correlation to become clearer. This should enable equities to participate in the return to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew normal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for UK markets as well. Back with the Bank of England and the suggestion of a May interest rate rise, economist Daniel Vernazza at UniCredit Bank is not entirely convinced: We retain our forecast for the MPC to remain on hold this year, largely because we expect economic activity and inflation to be weaker than the BoE expects. The main uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is how businesses and households react to progress in Brexit negotiations. On the one hand, any resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty is likely to boost confidence and demand On the other hand, any progress on Brexit negotiations will not become binding until ratified as part of the whole \u00e2\u20ac\u0153withdrawal agreement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be until Spring next year, and meanwhile the impact of uncertainty could increase as the potential cliff-edge of 29 March 2019 draws nearer and businesses act on their contingency plans. In addition, the November rate hike is still working its way through the economy and there are signs that the pace of slowing in the housing market has accelerated, with mortgage approvals dropping sharply in December and the Halifax house price index falling for two consecutive months. In our view, this provides sufficient reason for caution. But, as we have previously flagged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in light of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hawkish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Inflation Report \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the risks are increasingly skewed towards an earlier hike, possibly as soon as May. After Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last minute drop into negative territory last night, US markets are on the back foot once more. With bond prices falling and yields continuing to rise, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 100 points or 0.46% in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.04% lower while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.23%. There has been increasing talk that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates by four times this year, more times than previously expected. But Patrick Harker, president of the Philadelphia Fed, said: The public should heed the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that rates will probably rise soon, says Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The base rate may have remained the same today, however borrowers and savers should remain alert. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The word on the street suggests rate rises may be seen on the horizon for later in the year so now is the time to shop around with your borrowing and lock in your fixed deals at a low rate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The previous rate rise meant some people now pay more on their mortgage. Homeowners on variable rate deals should check whether they could save money by switching to a fixed rate or, if you have significant savings, offset mortgage; this may give you some protection against subsequent rate hikes and the difference could be thousands so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth exploring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over to the US, and earlier there were more signs of a stronger economy with the latest weekly jobless claims. The number of Americans claiming benefits fell unexpectedly last week by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000. Analysts were forecasting an increase to 232,000. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick wrap-up of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, after it voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that UK interest rates are not heading back to pre-crisis levels, despite hinting that borrowing costs will be hiked soon. Carney insisted that interest rate rises will be gradual and limited, and that borrowing costs won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit the 5% level. But he also reiterated that the UK is running out of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspare capacity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, creating pressure to raise borrowing costs. In order to bring it (inflation) back to target over a more conventional horizon which means moving it in from that three year horizon that it will be necessary, likely to be necessary,to raise interest rates to a limited degree in a gradual process but somewhat earlier and to a somewhat greater extent than we thought in November.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney warned that UK inflation could rise over 3% in the near term, but also offered optimism that wages will rise this year. The Bank has also hiked its growth forecasts a little for the next few years. The governor was sanguine about the recent market turmoil, pointing out that volatility had been unusually low recently. On Brexit, the governor pointed out that there have been benefits and costs... Investment is being restrained by Brexit related uncertainties. This remains the shallowest investment recovery in the UK for more than half a century. British exporters are in a sweet spot with sterling down 16% overall and around 20% against the euro in anticipation of a Brexit that has not yet happened.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also made a plea for those making forecasts about Brexit to release their underlying methodology and assumptions, so they can be properly interrogated. Carney refused to agree that interest rates are likely to rise in May, as many forecasts expect. But traders are already reacting. The pound has now jumped almost two cents today, to $1.4060. Government bond yields have weakened, though, while the FTSE 100 is down 0.8% or 60 points lower at 7219. City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta explains: Whilst policy makers at the Bank of England are unlikely to be considering 3 or 4 hikes this year, the possibility of two hikes across 2018 appears to be increasing. This brings forward the possibility of interest rates being hiked as early as the Spring with May being the most likely month, then an additional increase potentially in November. As the pound has strengthen, the FTSE has come under increased pressure. A stronger pound is less favourable for the international firms that make up 70% of the FTSE. Banks are one of the few sectors to move higher on the FTSE, as they stand to benefit from a higher interest rate environment. Perhaps a May hike is not nailed on: Jeremy Cook of World First has neatly summed up the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new forecasts: Q: Are you worried that Brexit will undermine confidence in economic forecasting - as any assumptions you make tend to look political. Mark Carney says that forecasters need to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transparent, up front\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the assumptions that underpin any Brexit forecasts. He also says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to release the model used when, say, comparing the impact of different trading relationships on the economy, along with the underlying assumptions. That means that people can \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinterrogate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 them. Brexit forecasts are a big issue in Britain today, after the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secret analysis was leaked. The governor then argues that some of the excitement over economic forecasts has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overplayed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be compared to weather forecasts -- unlike weather forecasters, we help make the weather, he points out. Carney concludes: The big picture there is something in these forecasts that tell people about how the economy is going to respond. But the challenge will come over the next year, when policymakers and the public become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot better informed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about Brexit. The bank, he pledges, will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely clear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about its forecasts, to provide a reference point to help us all understand the situation. The press conference is now over. Fidelity International\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global economist is not impressed by the Bank: The chief economist at the EY Item Club is not changing his rate forecasts despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkishness from the Bank: Q: When you raised rates in November, you said you expected banks to pass it on. But many savers haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the benefits.... Mark Carney says the pass-through has been similar to previous rate increases. Q: Little seems to have changed between November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one, so why are you so much more hawkish? Mark Carney denies that little has changed -- today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slightly stronger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But the future path of interest rates depends how the economy develops. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your take on the recent turmoil in the markets? Mark Carney says he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a running commentary, but points out that he and other policymakers have recently observed that volatility was extremely low. It is healthier when markets have two-way risks around prices, the governor explains. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to say the recent jump in volatility is welcome, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not an entirely surprising development\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: Would there be a material impact on your forecasts if Britain and the EU don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a transition deal by the end of March? Fair question, Mark Carney replies. It all depends on the impact on consumer confidence, business confidence and activity -- and whether a transition deal was agreed later than March, or not at all. Our forecasts is based on two Brexit factors - that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a smooth transition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that it leads to an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153average of potential outcomes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Carney says. Q: Is there a chance you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being too pessimistic about productivity, governor? Recent figures have shown it picking up (which would remove some pressure to raise interest rates) Carney says there is a risk either way, joking that the Bank has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153making the case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a pick-up in productivity, but the economy hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t played ball. Another clip from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: Good point..... Q: Will making companies report their gender pay gap help to fix this problem? Yes, Mark Carney replies. Extra transparency should force organisations and individuals to think about this issue and bring in policies to fix it. On a personal level, Carney says the Bank has found that it gets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better judgements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when there is more diversity. This message is slightly undermined by the fact that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference has a certain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmale, pale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feel to it: Carney insists the BoE is making progress. Thirty percent of senior managers are women, up from 20% five years ago. Q: Household consumption has fallen since the referendum, productivity is low, Brexit is causing uncertainty, and the markets went into meltdown this week -- so is this really a good time to wean the UK off cheap money? Mark Carney says some of these problems are linked. For example, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity problems mean the economy can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grow as fast as it used to without generating inflation. The speed limit of the economy has changed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower. And UK household spending is being driven by incomes, not debt -- so as real wages fall, people have had less money to spend. The governor then defends the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures - saying it has helped the economy ride out the storms. We have been providing a significant amount of support to this economy during very difficult periods. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the reasons unemployment is at a 40-year low, with more people in work than ever before. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the reasons why some adjustment of policy is necessary. Bad news for households: Mark Carney has warned that inflation could accelerate again in the next few months. During today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, he said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that inflation could rise back above 3%, temporarily, in the short term. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to higher import prices caused by the weak pound, he added. Q: Many experts are saying that an May interest rate rise is now \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Are they correct? Carney repeats that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be tied down. He then embarks on a long explanation about how market expectations have evolved in recent months, as the spare capacity within the UK economy has been used up. But the degree, and the exact timing, of interest rate rises, depends on how the economy develops. Carney then points to the European Union issue, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a crucial year for the Brexit negotiations. We will all be better informed by this time next year about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with the EU, he adds -- the impact could be positive, negative or neutral, though. Q: The markets think interest rates will be 1.25% by the start of 2020 - do you agree? Mark Carney says the Bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tie its hands. But he says people need to remember that the current interest rate cycles will be unlike those of the past. If you look before the financial crisis, bank rate was 5% on average, says Carney, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not talking about going back to those levels.....And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not talking about going at that pace [as seen in previous cycles]. Asked about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit scenarios, Carney says that business are reacting to the uncertainty. Households, though, are reacting to the squeeze in their real incomes - rather than Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term effects, the governor says. Q: Are you warning us that interest rates are going to rise faster than we thought? Our message is that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, interest rates will likely rise \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat sooner, and to a somewhat greater extent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than forecast in November, Carney clarifies. But it will still be a gradual process, with rates rising to a limited extent, he insists. On Brexit... Carney says the Bank has been setting monetary policy to balance its inflation targeting while protecting jobs and growth. It will keep doing that through the ups and downs in the financial markets, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctwists and turns\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of Brexit. Good news for workers -- Mark Carney says the Bank is increasingly confident that growth in wages and unit labour costs will pick up. Carney gets to the key message - the Bank of England thinks there is very little spare capacity in the UK economy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the BoE thinks that monetary policy will be tightened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than it expected three months ago. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, begins the press conference - with deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Dave Ramsden. Carney says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25 years since the Bank first created an inflation report. The backdrop to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is that the global economy is strong. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helping Britain -- net trade is contributing substantially to the UK economy British exporters are in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with a lower currency helping them sell overseas, Carney continues. But....business investment is being held back by Brexit uncertainty. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing, but much weaker than in previous economic cycles -- the shallowest recovery in 50 years. The Bank of England is holding a press conference now to discuss today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision, and the latest quarterly inflation report. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, predicts there will be at least one UK interest rate rise this year - and possibly two or three. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation remains significantly above target and will only fall back gradually as we move through this year, as the Bank of England recognises in its latest forecasts. Global inflationary pressures are building - with rising energy and food prices. And with the unemployment rate at its lowest level for over forty years, we could see some gradual rise in wage inflation. Alexandra Russell-Oliver, currency markets analyst at Caxton, says speculation of a May rate hike is building. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pound has rallied sharply towards 1.40 against the dollar and 1.14 against the euro after the BoE raised its economic growth and inflation projections and said it may need to increase rates earlier and to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greater extent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than thought in November. While markets had been pricing in a hike in November, speculation has been building recently that the BoE could move as soon as May, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish language shift will likely increase that speculation. A rate hike earlier in the year could help the pound maintain higher levels, but Brexit negotiations and political uncertainty remain a significant risk. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says there are some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153key takeaways\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new inflation report: Firstly, the expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a unanimous vote to leave interest rates on hold for now. The Bank raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade in November, and as such was fully expected to wait until later this year before considering a further upward move. However, the Bank upgraded its forecast for the UK economy slightly today, citing stronger global conditions. It now expects 1.8% growth this year, as against 1.6% forecast in November. Policymakers also said they will try and bring inflation back to their 2% target more quickly than previously, which means rates could rise faster and further than investors had expected. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric echoed that of September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting minutes, which preceded the November rate hike. It now looks like the next rise could happen as soon as May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the next time the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic forecasts are due to be updated. Prior to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, markets were factoring in a 50% chance of a rate rise in May, and an 80% chance they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be higher by the end of the year. You can read the minutes of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting online, here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour, explaining why the MPC left rates on hold: On the upside, momentum in global growth might persist for longer and the boost to UK demand from global factors could prove greater than anticipated. Global inflationary pressures had also shown signs of building. The tightness of the domestic labour market could result in faster wage and unit labour cost growth. The predicted pickup in productivity growth was not assured. On the downside, some business survey indicators of output had weakened. Recent housing and retail sales data had softened and, more generally, consumers might still respond to the past squeeze in real incomes to a greater degree than anticipated. And UK net trade could benefit by less from the pickup in global demand than had been the case recently. There was a possibility that the contribution of imported inflation pressures would diminish more rapidly than in the central projection. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, predicts that the next UK interest rate hike could come in May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the UK improves on wage growth and unemployment rates remain stable, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost certain that the MPC will rethink their strategy in Q2. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas you were\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for now but, pending Brexit developments in the new few months, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised to see Mark Carney take the plunge and raise interest rates for only the second time in a decade come May.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK government debt is also weakening, sending Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs to their highest level in over a year. The pound has jumped by a whole cent against the US dollar, following the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly hawkish announcement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now trading just below $1.40. The Bank of England has also raised its growth forecasts - predicting that the economy will expand faster than expected over the next couple of years. The Bank of England has warned that interest rates may rise sooner than previously expected. In the minutes of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, the BoE also warns that rates could rise higher than it forecast three months ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clear warning to households and businesses to expect rising borrowing costs - even though the BoE resisted hiking at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from the report: Were the economy to evolve broadly in line with the February Inflation Report projections, monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November Report. Breaking: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a unanimous decision too, with all nine policymakers voting to leave borrowing costs at their present level. More to follow! Tension is building in the City ahead of the Bank of England interest rate decision, due in 15 minutes. Although borrowing costs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to move, traders are wondering whether the Bank will use the minutes of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting to hint at future rate hikes. Mihir Kapadia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amidst a volatile week for the markets, traders are bracing themselves for the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision today. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision comes at a time when concerns over rising inflation and the possibility of more central banks tightening monetary policy is a key driver of the markets. Although most analysts expect that rates will be unchanged , traders will be watching for clues about the probability of the timing and probability of a future interest rate rise. The FTSE 100 is still in the red (down 63 points right now), while the pound is unchanged against the US dollar at $1.388.

He says: With the draining of marshes to make way for agricultural land, will-o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122-the-wisps are rarely sighted nowadays. But there remain plenty of distant flashing lights to distract travellers with promises of riches. As with the previous incarnation, these flashing lights often turn out to be just like bubbles of marsh gas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c insubstantial and foul-smelling, but also flammable and sometimes able to burn things around them. The most recent beguiling wisps are named variously \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cryptocurrencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to denote the use of cryptographic methods and technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153virtual currencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (VCs) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to denote their lack of legal recognition. He then hits out at Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inferiority to current payment systems. Bitcoin transactions generally require confirmation from six miners. With each block taking around ten minutes to mine, you would expect transactions to take an hour to process. But with recent network congestion, the average time for one confirmation can easily exceed several hours. At these speeds, if you bought a bunch of tulips with Bitcoin they may well have wilted by the time the transaction was confirmed. Mersch says regulators need to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcurgently\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 look at how virtual currencies are being used, but also concedes that the underlying technologies may yet have a bright future. The speech is online here. Newsflash: Another 101 Carillion workers have just lost their jobs, following the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse last month. The Official Receiver announced the latest redundancies this morning, alongside the better news that 1,221 jobs have been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafeguarded\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. A spokesperson says: We have continued to review Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contracts, as well as core divisions of the business, and I can confirm that we have safeguarded a further 1,221 jobs. These roles are connected to the delivery of both public and private contracts and cover services for a city council, as well as a range of facilities management services. This means so far, we have been able to save more than 2,000 jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Regrettably, we are also announcing that 101 roles have been made redundant. These are a mix of back-office functions and engineering support roles that new suppliers no longer require. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt management agency (PDMA) has decided to press ahead today with the sale of a new seven-year bond. The auction, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boldest foray yet onto international markets, had been put on ice by this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market turbulence, but is now back on! Helena Smith explains: The government hopes to bring in at least \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn from the markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a significant addition to the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.5bn cash buffer it has already built up to cover debt repayments when its third EU-IMF sponsored bailout programme ends. The seven-year euro benchmark had been postponed on account of market volatility with the sell off Monday. Now that markets have calmed down, the PDMA had decided to go ahead with the issue. Insiders say they expect the bond, which matures on February 15, 2015, to yield around 3.75%. The EU economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has begun a visit to Greece voicing optimism that the debt stricken country is well on the way to exiting its third international bailout programme. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens Holding talks with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of state, president Prokopis Pavalopoulos, the Frenchman not only expressed optimism that Athens was on the right track but went further still -- pinpointing a date by which the Euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem child will have exited its last economic adjustment programme. Once a fourth compliance reform review was over, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece could conclude its exit from the program by June 21,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Moscovici, who will be holding closed-door talks with Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos this afternoon, has long seen himself as a champion of Greece. Before arriving in Athens, he told the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state run news agency that his priority was to see Greece become a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal euro area member state.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now is the time for a final effort to complete the programme successfully and move to a more peaceful and bright future, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 he said, adding that discussions has already begun on restructuring Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering \u00e2\u201a\u00ac320bn debt load. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Technical work has already begun on a debt relief mechanism linked to economic growth, an idea first proposed last year and supported by the Eurogroup [of finance ministers] in June 2017\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Brexit fears are also looming over the City today. Nicky Morgan MP has heavily criticised the government for failing to publish its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153position paper on financial services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, leaving banks in the dark about the future. That comes hot on the heels of the news that a hard Brexit could cost Britain \u00c2\u00a380bn, with the north-east and the West Midlands hit particularly hard. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off leaves the FTSE 100 hovering around 7220 points. Earlier this week it hit a 13-month trough, below 7,100, before Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally clawed back some ground. Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades, says: The rebounds of yesterday certified, as we suggested, that so far it is too early to call an inversion and the right word to call this movement is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153correction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after an important bullish rally. The scenario could change if FTSE 100 goes below 7,000 points and DAX below 11,950. Mining companies are pushing the FTSE 100 deeper into the red. After two hours trading, the blue chip index is down 60 points, or 0.8%. BHP Billiton, Antofagasta and Glencore are all among the top fallers. It would be worse apart from food company Compass, which posted decent results this morning, and pharma firm GlaxosmithKline which beat expectations yesterday. David Madden of CMC Markets says City traders have been booking profits after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally: The weak finish in the US last night left traders feeling uneasy on this side of the Atlantic, and the optimistic sentiment that dominated yesterday has subsided. Traders are often nervous about holding a firm long position in the wake of a severe sell-off, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move is proof we are not out of the woods yet. At midday in the UK, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (BoE) update will be closely watched as it may add volatility to the pound. Equities (shares) have born the brunt of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility - with heavy losses in New York on Monday, then Europe and Asia on Tuesday. Larry Hatheway, group head of investment solutions at asset manager GAM, says there has been a rush to the exits, as traders who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d bet on low volatility were suddenly badly hit. So, with interest rates likely to rise in the months ahead, Hatheway predicts that shares will continue be buffeted around: The most outstanding feature of the adverse market movements has been the discrepancy between shifts in equity prices and those of other assets. Long equity and short equity implied volatility were among the most crowded trades, meaning that risk management manoeuvres in response to the initial market action accelerated the sell-off. Nevertheless, while technical factors may have contributed to the extent of the adjustment, the source of it appears to have been driven by fundamentals as market participants come to terms with the beginning of the exit from the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With the prospect of rising inflation both crimping corporate profits and making forthcoming monetary policy less predictable, we believe that expectations for equity returns need to be revised lower while implied volatility will rise from previously depressed levels. The team at ING have made a handy crib sheet showing what the Bank of England could do, and how the markets might react: UK department store group Debenhams has become the latest retailer to slash jobs. Debenhams is cutting 320 in-store management roles, as part of a push to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reduce cost and complexity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This comes a month after the company hit shareholders with a profits warning, following a disappointing Christmas. Several analysts are predicting that one or two Bank of England policymakers will vote to raise UK interest rates today. Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty are the most likely hawks, out of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says the vote could move the markets today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise to 0.75% is expected to come at some point in the next few months, with many thinking that the UK economy is performing well enough to shoulder a rate hike in May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What will be scrutinised most by traders is the composition of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. Any more than two thumbs up for a rate rise could see the pound make significant gains, while ears will then tune into any remarks Mark Carney follows up with. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale thinks the Bank might pave the way to a rate hike in three months. The UK MPC meets today with the market universally expecting no change in policy, but also expecting an element of hawkishness in preparation for a hike this spring. The market prices a 50% chance of a May hike and anything which pushes those expectations back leaves GBP (the British pound) a little vulnerable. Most analysts are sticking to the idea that the markets are going through a healthy correction, not a panicky crash. So investors have to decide whether to plunge in and buy some shares, or keep safely on the sidelines until things calm down. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great time to be a daredevil speculator, but long-term investors may not be enjoying the ride. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, predicts markets could shed another 10%: Many contrarians would like to follow Baron Rothschild\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buy when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood in the streets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As of now, I do not see any blood, but a healthy correction which has been overdue for a long time. From a valuation perspective, the forward price to earnings ratio on the S&amp;P 500 has dropped from 20 at the beginning of the year to below 18, suggesting that prices are still expensive when compared to historic averages. Deciding to buy, sell, or hold is a tough one in such circumstances, but if investors believe the global economy and corporates will continue firing on all cylinders, the downside risk is likely to be limited from current levels. However, another 5-10% correction should not be ruled out. Fixed income markets have started looking attractive and if the surge in bold yields resumes, there will be more incentives to pull out from stocks to bonds. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why bond markets, particularly in the U.S. will play a major role in how much further the correction may continue. Down we go again.... Trading is underway in London, where the FTSE 100 has dropped 28 points to 7251. The other European markets are also down, with the Stoxx 600 benchmark losing around 0.4%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another nervous day on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floors. Shares are expected to fall back, unravelling Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, as the wild swings that have dominated this week continue. Wall Street suffered a late wobble last night, with the Dow Jones surrendering all its gains to close slightly lower (down 19 points). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to feed through to the City, where the FTSE 100 is being called down around 0.6%. Worries over rising inflation and bond yields continue to drive the markets, with traders wondering how fast central banks will tighten monetary policy. That means the Bank of England will be centre stage today. The BoE will set interest rates at noon today, and also release its latest quarterly inflation report -- packed with new economic forecasts. One or two policymakers may vote for a rate hike -- but the majority will almost certainly vote to leave rates at 0.5%. The big question is whether the BoE is inching closer to raising borrowing costs in May. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says governor Mark Carney will face plenty of questions about the UK economic outlook: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to offer too many surprises on the rates front, the main steer for the next move in the pound will come from Governor Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment of the UK economy, which he has already stated is suffering from under investment as a result of the uncertainty being generated by the Brexit talks. Markets will also be looking for any further steers on the outlook for wages growth, as well as productivity which has also started to show signs of improving. It will be in the area of wages that markets could well focus most of their attention, particularly in light of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong US wages numbers, which has made bond markets globally particularly susceptible to how policy makers view the outlook for them.

There has been a spike in volatility, which has resulted in a blow-up in low-volatility strategies and a sharp dive in negatively correlated US index ETFs.

Fear of rising bond yields can easily produce a bear market (down 20% from 52-week highs) despite a healthy global economy. In fact, that is usually how it happens because the stock market is a future-discounting mechanism. Another argument for a bigger move lower is that much of what has helped keep the stock market moving higher is momentum, which is now reversing. We would liken the outlook for the US stock market to making a tackle in sports, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the bigger they are the harder they fall.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>A 10% market correction historically happens on average every 18 months, marking it a very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd phenomenon. The key point this time around is that market conditions since 2009 have been very abnormal thanks to unprecedented central bank support. We would interpret these latest market moves as a part of a significant transition. It is most likely a transition to a more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd resumption of the bull market with higher volatility but the risk of it being a swift transition to a bear market should not be underestimated. We maintain, but are more cautious of our year-end forecast of the S&amp;P 500 at 2,900.</p> <p>Right now, there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshake out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 taking place as bulls and bears battle for dominance. The Dow Jones has found near term support above 23,000. We suspect more mean reversion will take the Dow below its 200-day moving average near 22,850. In conclusion, it may be a bit early to buy the dip but wild swings, potentially as high as 26,000 will provide ample opportunities for day traders.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7da62be4b0365be5168a8a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-09T13:47:11.890Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of the falls we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen through the bull market, from analyst Barry Ritholtz:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ritholtz/status/961932705502871553\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Memory is famously short during bull markets.

                "bodyText":"Stock markets are ending the week on another volatile note. After overnight falls on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets headed lower, although the falls were reduced once US markets opened in positive territory. The FTSE 100 was, for once, not much helped by renewed weakness in sterling. The pound fell back against both the dollar and the euro following comments from EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that a transition deal was not a given. On the economic front, there was a mixed picture from the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest manufacturing, construction and trade figures. But think tank NIESR issued a positive estimate of UK GDP for the three months to January. And in corporate news, Trinity Mirror finally unveiled its long awaited deal to buy rival Northern &amp; Shell, owner of Express Newspapers. On that night, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. After the latest plunge in US markets drove them into correction territory, Wall Street has got off to a better start, as indicated by the futures earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 310 points (although not all the constituents are trading yet), while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 1% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.1%. It may be too early to buy the dips, and more wild swings are possible, sayd Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group: US benchmark share indices falling into correction territory (down over 10% from record highs) has ignited concern the bull market has ended. There has been a spike in volatility, which has resulted in a blow-up in low-volatility strategies and a sharp dive in negatively correlated US index ETFs. The question is whether this is the technical trigger for wider market contagion or just a long overdue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153healthy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pullback for an over-extended market. We would make the point that the stock market can deviate massively from economic fundamentals in the short term. Fear of rising bond yields can easily produce a bear market (down 20% from 52-week highs) despite a healthy global economy. In fact, that is usually how it happens because the stock market is a future-discounting mechanism. Another argument for a bigger move lower is that much of what has helped keep the stock market moving higher is momentum, which is now reversing. We would liken the outlook for the US stock market to making a tackle in sports, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the bigger they are the harder they fall.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A 10% market correction historically happens on average every 18 months, marking it a very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd phenomenon. The key point this time around is that market conditions since 2009 have been very abnormal thanks to unprecedented central bank support. We would interpret these latest market moves as a part of a significant transition. It is most likely a transition to a more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd resumption of the bull market with higher volatility but the risk of it being a swift transition to a bear market should not be underestimated. We maintain, but are more cautious of our year-end forecast of the S&amp;P 500 at 2,900. Right now, there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshake out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 taking place as bulls and bears battle for dominance. The Dow Jones has found near term support above 23,000. We suspect more mean reversion will take the Dow below its 200-day moving average near 22,850. In conclusion, it may be a bit early to buy the dip but wild swings, potentially as high as 26,000 will provide ample opportunities for day traders. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of the falls we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen through the bull market, from analyst Barry Ritholtz: This market fall is a dose of reality after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greed ran unchecked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Mark Dowding, co-head of investment grade at BlueBay Asset Management: The equity market reversal this week, may well serve to be a healthy event. Greed was running unchecked in January and so markets were due a dose of reality, or else the party risked getting out of hand.. this is no bad thing at all and may well serve to make life easier for investors over time. There could be worse to come for the pound following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls, suggests Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst: Every single bit of optimism afforded to the pound on the back of Governor Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on interest rate increases and upgraded growth and wage forecasts has been lost this morning following the comments from Michel Barnier that the transitional period is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot a given\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. For sterling, nothing is more important in the short term than a transitional deal that extends the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the Single Market and Customs Union. The CBI has been vocal on the need for clarity for its members and small and medium sized businesses who we speak to every day have echoed those sentiments. So far, the broad swings in equity and volatility markets that have made headlines this week have not been felt in currency markets but if they do there are a fair many more currencies that would be seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bet than sterling given the political atmosphere. The market falls appear to be getting worse in Europe, as the Dow futures lose much of their earlier gains. The FTSE 100 is now down 61 points or 0.86%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 1.7% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 1.6%. The Dow futures are now indicating a 47 point rise at the open, down from nearly 300 points. The pound is coming under pressure on the latest Brexit developments. A post-Brexit transition deal is not a given, according to the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief negotiator Michel Barnier after the latest set of talks. He said Britain had raised substantial issues with the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal, and said some of the EU positions were not negotiable. He said: If these differences persist, a transition is not a given. If these disagreements were to persist there would undoubtedly be a problem. I hope we will be able to resolve these disagreements in the next round. The sooner the UK makes its choices, the better. The news has sent the pound down 0.63% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1279, while against the dollar sterling is 0.78% lower at \u00c2\u00a21.3803. But economies and markets do not necessarily go hand in hand, says Justin Urquart-Stewart of Seven Investment Management: The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to January, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The think tank said this was the same as the official figures for the final quarter of 2017. Up until now surveys had suggested a slowdown at the start of the year. NIESR expects UK GDP to grow by 1.9% this year and next, but warned there would be a marked slowdown if Brexit talks failed. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at NIESR, said: We estimate that economic growth was steady at 0.5 per cent in the 3 months to January. Activity picked up in the second half of 2017 after a period of subdued growth in the first half of the year. The recovery was driven by both the manufacturing and the service sectors, supported by a buoyant global economy, while construction output continued to lag. We are forecasting GDP growth of close to 2 per cent this year assuming a soft Brexit scenario. At this speed the economy could start to overheat unless the Bank of England withdraws some of the stimulus that it has injected by raising the policy rate. Our forecast assumes a 25 basis point increase in May and then every 6 months until Bank Rate reaches 2 per cent by mid-2021. If instead, Brexit talks fail, the UK economy will in our view suffer a marked slowdown with damaging longer term consequences. The Dow futures are off their best but are still indicating a higher open on Wall Street after the latest plunge. But the futures have not been the best guide to what happens. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: US futures are trading slightly in the green ahead of the open on Friday, a day after stock markets once again tumbled leaving indices in correction territory. As we saw on Thursday, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily indicative of calm returning to the markets. The Dow recorded declines of more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, having never done so before, despite futures prior to the open being relatively unchanged on the previous days close. Clearly there remains a lot of volatility and nervousness in the markets and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this to ease up heading into the weekend. Stock markets will likely remain vulnerable to further shocks heading into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close and possible even next week. That said, with a 10% correction having now completed, I wonder whether investors will now start looking to buy the dips as the fundamental backdrop remains strong. A positive move is that the US Congress has passed a funding bill which will avoid a government shutdown, but Erlam is not convinced this will have much impact on shares: Markets haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been too concerned about the prospect of a shutdown since the start of the year despite two having now taken place so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to see any boost now that a deal has been reached. This is merely just another self-inflicted risk that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been temporarily averted. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent seems relatively relaxed about the recent stock market falls. In his tour of BBC studios, he told the Today programme: Equity markets go up and down, you have a correction of this size roughly every 18 months on average, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not terrifically unusual....If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re suggesting that this is somehow parallel to what happened in 2007, then I would say no. I think there are some very big differences and as I pointed out, the equity markets, particularly in the US, have risen a lot over the last 12 months and indeed, even today, we are roughly back where we were a couple of months ago. (That may be true of Wall Street, but not the FTSE 100 according to the charts.....) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a useful chart of the UK trade figures: European markets remain fairly calm, although of course that may all change once Wall Street reopens. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European stocks are lower this morning, but are holding up relatively well when you consider the magnitude of the declines in Asia overnight and in the US last night. Investor are clearly nervous in this part of the world, and there are still concerns things could turn sour again. The erratic moves that have taken place in the US are unsettling investors here, and the sentiment in Europe could change when trading in New York resumes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the British Chambers of Commerce on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK data. Its head of economics Suren Thiru said: The sharp deterioration in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net trade position in December was disappointing and means that trade is likely to have been a drag on UK growth in the final quarter of the year. This deterioration reflects a significant increase in imports in the quarter, more than offsetting the rise in exports. Although there was a surprise pick-up in construction output, the sector remains a concern and together with the widening in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit and weakening industrial output indicates that economic conditions are becoming more sluggish. While many exporters are benefiting from stronger growth in key trading markets, imports continue to grow at a solid pace with businesses continuing to report little in the way of import substitution despite their high cost. If this trend continues as we expect, the contribution of net trade to UK GDP growth over the near term is likely to be limited at best. As we move through the Brexit process more needs to be done to provide clarity on what the future trading relationship with the EU will look like. Action is also needed to address the longstanding issues, from the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skills gap to our creaking digital and physical infrastructure, that continue to undermine the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade performance. The UK data has been little help to the pound: Back with the UK data, and economist James Knightley at ING Bank says the latest figures suggest fourth quarter growth could be revised downwards: Softer December trade and production data coupled with downward revisions suggest the potential for fourth quarter GDP growth to be revised down to 0.4% quarter on quarter [from 0.5%] UK industrial production fell 1.3% month on month in December, worse than the 0.9% consensus while there was a 0.1 percentage point downward revision to November. The December softness relates to the shutdown of the North Sea Forties pipeline for unplanned maintenance (oil and gas output fell 24.2% month on month) and should rebound in January, but it does suggest the risk of a very modest downward revision to fourth quarter GDP. Manufacturing rose 0.3% month on month, in line with expectations, while November was revised down two-tenths of a percentage point to 0.2% growth. There was also disappointment in the December trade balance. It showed a deficit of \u00c2\u00a34.9bn [for total goods and services] \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the worst reading since September 2016, which is a pretty poor story given the competitiveness boost sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big declines should have provided and the stronger economic activity data we have seen globally. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data reinforces the message that the UK continues to underperform other developed market economies, growing at around half the rate of the US and the Eurozone. As such, while the Bank of England is clearly hinting at the potential for a May rate hike, we remain cautious on the longer term path for rates, particularly given the Brexit related uncertainty. The latest GDP estimates from the NIESR think tank are due around lunchtime. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest view from Chris Iggo, chief investment officer fixed income at AXA Investment Managers, on the current markets: Volatility is back and those that bet on it never coming back have had a tough week. Why is it back? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back because the macro fundamentals are evolving in a way that many of us have expected but some have denied. Growth is strong, inflation is not dead and interest rates are rising. This is spooking the bond market and the bond market spooks everyone else. The veracity of the moves in equities are explained by the existence of structured trades, algorithms and leverage, but the reason that valuations are being challenged is because the discount rate is rising and is not going back down any time soon. Bond investors might start to be tempted to buy US Treasuries as we approach a 3% yield but the cat is out of the bag \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are in a higher yield environment than we have been for the last three years and that is a bit of a problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not a terminal problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but a bit of a problem for equities. Back to the markets and the subdued performance so far in Europe despite the hefty falls on Wall Street and in Asia. City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta said: A renewed, deep, sell off on Wall Street and in Asia overnight ensured a heavy drop was on the cards for European bourses this morning.... Interestingly the selloff in Europe is less exaggerated than that in the US and that is because in Europe we continue to see dividend yields outpacing government debt yields. Meanwhile that dynamic is reversing at a rapid rate in the US which is not working in the favour of US equities despite solid economic data and a strong earnings outlook. There has just been a spate of UK economic data, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture. Industrial production fell sharply in December, hit by a shutdown of the Forties north sea oil pipeline. After a 0.4% month on month rise in November, it fell 1.3% the following month, worse than the 0.9% decline expected. But manufacturing output was in line with forecasts, up 0.3% month on month. The year on year rise of 1.4% was the weakest since April 2017. But there was a better than expected performance from the key construction sector, with output up 1.6% month on month compared for forecasts of a flat performance. To complete picture, the trade deficit was also higher than expected. The goods trade balance came in at -\u00c2\u00a313.576bn in December, up from the -\u00c2\u00a311.6bn expected and the biggest deficit since September 2016. The Dow futures are still indicating a positive start for US markets. But US bond yields are on the rise again, which could throw a spanner in the works: At the risk of tempting fate, it seems a little bit calmer in the markets so far. The FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline is hovering at around 32 points or 0.4%, while there are similar dips on the German and French markets. The mood is probably being helped by the futures market suggesting an opening bounce on the Dow Jones Industrial Average of up to 270 points after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump. But it is early days yet, and in such volatile markets it is dangerous to take anything for granted. More on the BBC interview with the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Broadbent. He said the low level of interest rates reflected global factors and said there was no fixed path for tightening policy: But nor do I think if there were to be a couple of 25 basis point rises in a year, that that would somehow be a great shock. Reuters has a report here. And another big gainer. Hogg Robinson shares have surged 50% to 117p after the business travel group received a 120p a share or near \u00c2\u00a3400m takeover offer from American Express. At the same time it has agreed to sell its payments technology business to Visa. News of the deals has sent its shares up nearly 50% to 116p. One company to buck the downward trend is Trinity Mirror. Its shares have climbed 10% following news that it has finally completed the long-awaited takeover of rival Northern &amp; Shell, owner of Express newspapers. Our report on the deal is here: As expected, the sell-off on Wall Street and in Asia has spilled over into Europe, but so far there has not been a dramatic decline. The FTSE 100 is down around 30 points or 0.4% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 0.1%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.2% lower and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has fallen 0.57%. Tony Blair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old theme song \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Things can only get better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd seems to have been taken up by the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Broadbent. On Thursday the Bank hinted strongly that interest rate rises were on the way, sooner perhaps than people expected. This of course fed into the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 current concerns about dearer borrowing costs and the withdrawal of central bank stimulus. Today Broadbent has told the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wake up to Money that the worst of the squeeze on real wages was over and the economy is improving: The worst of the squeeze was about a year ago and if you look at what happened to real household incomes during the second half of last year they were flat, and if you ask me what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening right now in the first quarter, they are starting to rise. The squeeze from that depreciation is coming off, the path from higher important prices is probably at its peak and we are starting to see wage growth improve. So things will get better from that point of view. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grim start to the day weatherwise in London and it looks like its going to be a grim start for European stock markets, as the sell-off which began in earnest a week or so ago looks set to continue. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just joining us, Wall Street and Asian markets suffered renewed falls as the concerns about rising interest rates continues to spook investors. With signs of inflation returning, central banks are increasingly withdrawing the measures - low interest rates, quantitative easing - which have been supporting markets since the financial crisis. And markets do not like it. The sell-off has been exacerbated by the growing prevalence of program trades which exaggerate market moves, and a number of bets on the volatility index staying low which have gone wrong. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its second-biggest one-day points fall, down 1,032.89, while the S&amp;P 500 hit correction territory, ie a 10% decline from its recent peak. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index lost 2.32% while the turmoil spilled over into China, with the Shanghai Composite closing down 4.1% in one of its worst days for two years. Positive economic data and hints from the Bank of England that interest rates could rise in May put pressure on bond prices, and in turn equities. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our overnight blog giving all the developments: And our latest markets story: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: It would appear that the brief respite for stocks seen in the middle of the week turned out to be the eye of the storm as once again rising bond yields prompted a further bout of selling across the board, not only in the US last night but in Asia again this morning. Concerns about rising interest rates weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by an unexpectedly hawkish inflation report from the Bank of England yesterday, while the latest Chinese trade data suggested that the Chinese economy appeared to be ticking along nicely, even if the trade surplus did shrink quite sharply as a result of a big jump in imports. US weekly jobless claims also dropped sharply to 221k, once again reinforcing the tightness of the US labour market which in turn could well put further upward pressure on wages in the months ahead. As a result US bond yields started edging higher again with the 10 year yield once again looking to retest the 2.9% level and a four year high, with the 3% level now a very realistic probability. A US government shutdown which started at midnight isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping sentiment either. While this continued optimism about how the US economy is likely to perform is a good thing, for US stocks whose valuations are still at elevated levels, they may not be particularly good news given that yield differentials are no longer working in their favour, unlike in Europe where dividend yields are still higher than the yields on government debt. This may help explain why the Dow and S&amp;P500 once again closed sharply lower again, with the Dow losing over 1,000 points, and in the process closing in correction territory, while the VIX once again popped higher. As a result of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off in the US, and this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness in Asia, European markets look set to follow suit this morning and open lower, while the Nikkei 225 also slid into correction territory as it tested its long term 200 day moving average. So here are the opening calls for Europe from IG: Almost incidentally there are a few bits of economic data due, including UK trade and industrial production figures. Agenda: 9.30 GMT: UK industrial production 9.30 GMT: UK trade figures 9.30 GMT UK construction output 12.00 GMT: NIESR economic growth forecast",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The best that can be said about the product is that it did exactly what it said on the tin: XIV was virtually wiped out with Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4% market fall in the US.</p> \n<p>But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the intriguing question. Did the sheer weight of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short vol\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bets in the market, via XIV and its imitators, cause the volatility? And, once the selling started, were the pressures intensified because all those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short vol\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd positions had to be reversed in a hurry? Was the market feeding on itself?</p> \n<p>Sandy Rattray, who jointly devised the formula to trade futures contracts tied to the VIX back in 2003, thinks so. He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8aaee774-0cdd-11e8-8eb7-42f857ea9f09\">told the FT</a> this week that this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t merely a case of the tail wagging the dog. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What happened on Monday was the tail grabbed the dog and gave it a swing around the room,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.</p> \n<p>Rattray is not alone in thinking inverse VIX products, and those that spice up profits and losses by using leverage, are ridiculous. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are not liquid and, under stress, do not perform like plain-vanilla ETFs tied to physical securities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said BlackRock, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fund manager, which refuses to sell them. It agrees that leveraged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short vol\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd investment products \u00e2\u20ac\u0153magnified a downdraft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in stock markets.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/10/vix-fear-index-volatility-danger-zone-30-50-points\">Its needle is pointing to the danger zone.

One worry is that the problems go deeper. A big concern is that the two years of calm in the VIX encouraged investors to believe it was safe to make risky bets in their never-ending search for income.</p> \n<p>Alex Brazier, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive director for financial stability, gave a well-timed speech at the start of this month in which he likened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short vol\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to selling insurance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If markets stay stable, as the insurer is betting they will, no payout is made and the insurance collects a premium. If markets stay stable, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice little earner for the insurer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<p>But there could be two knock-on effects. First, betting on low volatility could become self-fulfilling as buyers of the insurance contracts hedge their positions in market; that encourages more people to sell insurance. Then, because the world seems less risky, investors take on more risk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is the dangerous part.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f6c0689b-63b6-43ab-a392-0974cf672d6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>22.61% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c&nbsp;19 October 1987</b></p>\n    <p>Global markets fall amid growing tensions in the&nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039Middle&nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u2039East between Iran and the US, with warships attacked.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>12.82% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c&nbsp;28 October 1929</b></p>\n    <p>Wall Street Crash of 1929 which began the previous Thursday continues on Black Monday as the economy&nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039starts to worsen.</p>\n    <p><b>11.99% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c&nbsp;18 December 1899</b></p>\n    <p>The suspension of shares in Produce Exchange Trust Company prompted fears of a market bubble in industrial stocks.</p>\n    <p><b>11.73% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c&nbsp;29 October 1929</b></p>\n    <p>The Wall Street Crash continues on Black Tuesday.</p>\n    <p><b>9.92% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c&nbsp;6 November 1929</b></p>\n    <p>Shares continue to fall before bottoming out on 13 November.</p>\n    <p><b>8.4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c&nbsp;12 August 1932</b></p>\n    <p>Markets weaken as the Great Depression worsens.</p>\n    <p><b>8.29% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c&nbsp;14 March 1907</b></p>\n    <p>A run on banks amid a recession led to a financial crisis, which was only ended after banker JP Morgan pledged his own money to shore up the system.</p>\n    <p><b>8.04% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c&nbsp;26 October 1987</b></p>\n    <p>Continuing fallout from the Black Monday turmoil.</p>\n    <p><b>7.87% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c&nbsp;15 October 2008</b></p>\n    <p>As the global financial crisis continues, concerns grow despite global bank bailout plans unveiled.</p>\n    <p><b>7.84% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c&nbsp;21 July 1933</b></p>\n    <p>Markets continue to fall during the Great Depression.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking on more risk because implied volatility is low is the equivalent of ignoring the road conditions and driving faster because your insurance got cheaper as a herd of new entrants flooded the car insurance market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Brazier. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When accidents start to increase, the whole thing can go into reverse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<p>Is that what happened this week?

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates.

Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>World stock markets have dropped sharply from recent record highs over the past week.

Now, with wages rising and the global economy booming, central banks look set to end the era of cheap money. As stock markets panic about the short-term impact on share prices, Richard Sylla, the co-author of the seminal <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Interest_Rates.html?id=w3hmC17-em4C\">A History of Interest Rates,</a> poses a longer-term question: where are we?

If we are as lucky this time and follow a similar course, Sylla says, we are likely to see less speculation in stocks as well as moderate increases or stable house prices.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153As interest rates begin to normalize, stocks and real estate are certainly not going to be going up at the rates they have been. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the rosy scenario \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if we move from abnormally low interest rates to more normal interest rate over a period of time, even over 10 years ahead, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to cause inflation or slow the economy.

                "bodyText":"Remember Quantum Leap? In the sci-fi show, time traveling scientist Sam Beckett would wake up in another era and have to work out where he was in history before solving this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mystery. Well, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the position the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economists and traders are in this week. Since the end of the last recession, interest rates have been at a historic low. Now, with wages rising and the global economy booming, central banks look set to end the era of cheap money. As stock markets panic about the short-term impact on share prices, Richard Sylla, the co-author of the seminal A History of Interest Rates, poses a longer-term question: where are we? The 1950s or the 1970s? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are certainly at a turning point,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sylla, professor emeritus of economics at the history of financial institutions and markets at the Stern School of Business in New York. According to Sylla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s studies, interest rates have trended in 20 to 30 year cycles and we are overdue a sustained period of interest rate increases. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Interest rates have been abnormally low and for the first time in a long time every economy in the world is expanding. So everything tells me the trend is going to be up. The question is, what sort of trend will it be?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sylla offers two relevant historical models \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 1950s and the 1970s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c periods with starkly different economic outcomes. 1950s In the early 50s, US central bankers began to gently raise interest rates after a period of sustained low rates that ran from the Great Depression through the second world war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From the early 50s to the early 60s, there was a gradual upward trend in interest rates that did not interfere with economic growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sylla explains. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of the fastest economic growth took place in the 50s, so the idea that rising interest rates have a negative affect on the economy is probably wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The 1950s ushered in the golden age of capitalism. If we are as lucky this time and follow a similar course, Sylla says, we are likely to see less speculation in stocks as well as moderate increases or stable house prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As interest rates begin to normalize, stocks and real estate are certainly not going to be going up at the rates they have been. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the rosy scenario \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if we move from abnormally low interest rates to more normal interest rate over a period of time, even over 10 years ahead, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to cause inflation or slow the economy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we should hope for now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 1970s The alternative is the early 1970s. Under that scenario, central bankers raised the target fed funds rate higher 21 times over the course of 1973 as it attempted to tame inflation, stalling the US economy until it slid into stagflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where prices rise faster than growth. While there is no energy crisis on the horizon, Sylla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc70s scenario focuses on the effect of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.5trn tax cut at a time of almost full-employment coupled with new, multi-billion government spending allocations. In other words, a sugar rush just when the central bank is looking to gently cool, not aggressively stimulate, the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I see the signs of fiscal irresponsibility out there mainly in things like bitcoin and crypto-currencies but also in the stock market, which has been propped up by very low interest rates. That could turn this into a 1970s-type scenario when interest rates rose very rapidly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sylla. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 50-50 chance inflation will heat up and that will force the Fed to raise rates faster. So it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a normalization or rates, it will be a more rapid rise because the Fed will start to fight the inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And that, Sylla predicts, could be the cause of the next recession. Increasing volatility The unfolding situation is likely contributing to the volatility we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the markets over the past week, says Simon Johnson, an MIT professor of global economics and management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The markets are trying to grapple with the sudden realization that the Trump-Republican economic policies amount to a short-term economic stimulus in an economy that appears to have very little slack,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he explains. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve put an expansionary fiscal policy into a situation where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at or close to full employment.

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The IMF does not always get it right but on this occasion Lagarde nailed it. Over the past week, shares on Wall Street have fallen sharply, with the Dow Jones recording <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/08/dow-jones-sinks-again-as-bond-yields-rise-and-higher-inflation-feared\">1,000-point-plus declines on two separate days.</a><br></p> \n<p>Speaking in Dubai on Sunday, in her first public comments since the market turmoil, Lagarde said she remained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonably optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we cannot sit back and wait for growth to continue as normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> \n<p>Somewhat perversely, the markets came down for the same reason as they rose steadily throughout 2017: because of the brighter economic news Lagarde reported. The trigger for the sell-off was a US labour market report, which showed more jobs being created, wages going up and unemployment at 4.1%.</p> \n<p>Most Americans would struggle to work out why this would cause share prices to plunge. After all, unemployment has been coming down steadily for years, during which time US workers have struggled to make ends meet. Annual earnings growth is still running below 3%.<br></p> \n<p>But from the perspective of Wall Street, these are now seen as unwelcome developments. In 2017, the financial markets bought shares because they thought the US was in for a prolonged period of strong growth, weak inflation and low interest rates. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/10/turmoil-stock-markets-10-years-cheap-money-ends\">Test of nerve for markets as 10 years of cheap money come to an end</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The moment the jobs report came out it was as though a switch had been flipped. Markets now viewed stronger US growth with trepidation because they thought it would result in higher inflation and tougher action from the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package of tax cuts, finally pushed through Congress at the end of last year, ceased to be the growth-boosting, productivity enhancing benefit to the economy it had been in 2017 and suddenly became a means of overheating the economy and driving up the US budget deficit. Because Washington would need to borrow more to bridge the gap between its spending and its tax revenue, the assumption was that interest rates would need to rise.</p> \n<p>As it happens, some of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assumptions are questionable. Take the idea that America is running at full employment, for example, where the 4.1% jobless rate masks the fact that labour market participation has yet to get back to where it was at the start of the Great Recession a decade ago. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment rate is currently just over 60% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 percentage points lower than it was in 2008.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a4c82a7-3e7d-44a8-8d40-18e25102ff4f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Inflation is when prices rise.

                "bodyText":"Christine Lagarde had good news to tell when she turned up in Davos three weeks ago to announce the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic forecasts. The global economy was doing better than expected pretty much everywhere, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director said. There was, though, another message, a warning not to get too carried away about a recovery that had left out large numbers of people and was not based on particularly solid foundations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is also significant uncertainty in the year ahead,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lagarde said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The long period of low interest rates has led to a buildup of potentially serious financial sector vulnerabilities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF does not always get it right but on this occasion Lagarde nailed it. Over the past week, shares on Wall Street have fallen sharply, with the Dow Jones recording 1,000-point-plus declines on two separate days. Speaking in Dubai on Sunday, in her first public comments since the market turmoil, Lagarde said she remained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonably optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we cannot sit back and wait for growth to continue as normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Somewhat perversely, the markets came down for the same reason as they rose steadily throughout 2017: because of the brighter economic news Lagarde reported. The trigger for the sell-off was a US labour market report, which showed more jobs being created, wages going up and unemployment at 4.1%. Most Americans would struggle to work out why this would cause share prices to plunge. After all, unemployment has been coming down steadily for years, during which time US workers have struggled to make ends meet. Annual earnings growth is still running below 3%. But from the perspective of Wall Street, these are now seen as unwelcome developments. In 2017, the financial markets bought shares because they thought the US was in for a prolonged period of strong growth, weak inflation and low interest rates. The moment the jobs report came out it was as though a switch had been flipped. Markets now viewed stronger US growth with trepidation because they thought it would result in higher inflation and tougher action from the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package of tax cuts, finally pushed through Congress at the end of last year, ceased to be the growth-boosting, productivity enhancing benefit to the economy it had been in 2017 and suddenly became a means of overheating the economy and driving up the US budget deficit. Because Washington would need to borrow more to bridge the gap between its spending and its tax revenue, the assumption was that interest rates would need to rise. As it happens, some of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assumptions are questionable. Take the idea that America is running at full employment, for example, where the 4.1% jobless rate masks the fact that labour market participation has yet to get back to where it was at the start of the Great Recession a decade ago. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment rate is currently just over 60% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 percentage points lower than it was in 2008. Nor was the rise in wages quite all that it seemed, since most of the beneficiaries were those in senior positions. Annual earnings growth for those in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153production non-supervisory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd positions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bottom 83% of the jobs market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was 2.4%. But Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assumption that the Federal Reserve is keen to raise interest rates is correct. The City is getting a similar message from the Bank of England, that UK borrowing costs might need to go up faster than hitherto expected. There is no suggestion that interest rates will need to rise to their pre-crisis levels. Indeed, both the Fed and the Bank of England have been at pains to point out that the tightening of policy will be gradual and modest. Threadneedle Street probably envisages raising rates to around 2.5% in quarter-point steps over the coming years, which would leave them well below the 5% average since the Bank was founded in 1694. Yet even this looks quite a stretch. For almost a decade now, the major developed economies have relied on heavy doses of stimulus from their central banks to generate growth. Interest rates have had to be kept low and money printed on an enormous scale through the process known as quantitative easing because finance ministries have adopted austerity policies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c higher taxes and cuts in public spending \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in an attempt to reduce budget deficits.

But Bob Prince, co-chief investment officer at the $160bn US hedge fund Bridgewater, told the Financial Times on Monday (paywall): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There had been a lot of complacency built up in markets over a long time, so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this shakeout will be over in a matter of days. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably have a much bigger shakeout coming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Bassanese, the chief economist at BetaShares Capital in Sydney, said in a note on Sunday that despite the big falls last week, the selling could continue. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153History suggests the depth of corrections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c assuming the underlying bull market persists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually get beyond 15%, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly some scope for market weakness before a bottom is reached,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Investors would be jittery about US inflation figures on Wednesday, he said. The market was forecasting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairly benign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 1.7% annual prices growth, but anything above that was likely to result in more stock losses. The fear of rising US bond yields and higher inflation thanks to higher wages is what sparked the current wave of selling on 2 February as investors digested the prospect of higher interest rates as a result. Chris Weston at online trader IG said on Monday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A massive buildup in market leverage has been partially unwound in the blink of an eye and what started as systematic funds selling out of equity and futures positions, as implied volatility headed higher, has morphed into something far more broad-based incorporating many other market participants.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Craig James, CommSec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist in Sydney, said the US rally on Friday gave cause for hope but traders were still likely to face continued volatility. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We may be a little bit softer at the start of trade on the back of the resources but overall I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a choppy session,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The volatility is still going to be with us for most of the week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Analysts at JP Morgan said in a note on Saturday they remained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about world stock markets because sustainable topline growth driven by higher wages would underpin earnings and benefit shares. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index ended Friday down 0.9% at 5,838 points leaving it down 4.6% for the week. In the US, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a much broader index to the 30-company Dow Jones average \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fell 5.2% for the week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since January 2016. The FTSE100 in London ended the week about 5% down. Australian banking stocks were badly hit on the day that a royal commission began hearings into misconduct by the financial services industry, while resources stocks suffered amid falling prices for oil, gold, iron ore and other key commodities.",

Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>After successfully raising \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn from its sale of a seven-year bond last week, Athens is now looking to complete at least two more bond sales as part of wider steps to reinforce market access and show investors it can go it alone. </p> <p>The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has hinted that future issues could include a three-year bond \u00e2\u20ac\u201c launched around the time of the March 4 general elections in Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a ten-year bond. The government has announced plans to build a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19bn cash buffer that would allow the debt stricken country to cover debt repayments once the bailout programme expires. </p> <p>Market turbulence in the form of more corrections, however, could yet dash plans to create the safety net. Volatility in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off caused the government to delay trade of the seven -year bond by 48 hours proving that while Greece has progressed both fiscally and in terms of structural reforms it is still at risk of exogenous forces. The seven-year bond was sold at a yield of 3.5% with UK investors leading the pack of more than 200 hedge funds, banks and fund managers who lodged bids.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd514401d1d9ec9a81489c6640f92c10e56ae626\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd514401d1d9ec9a81489c6640f92c10e56ae626/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsakalotos in his office in the finance ministry in Athens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsakalotos in his office in the finance ministry in Athens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Costas Baltas/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a817d79e4b027761ed47cd8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-12T11:44:16.963Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The stock market falls we have been seeing are not unusual but did take longer than expected to happen, says Richard Stammers, investment strategist at European Wealth Group.

The definition of a correction is 10% off from the recent high and of a bear market, 20% off from the year high. So, whilst we are not in bear market territory, we need to recognise for every short term bounce there could be an equal and opposite slide back. Could we see lows of 15%? Quite possibly so, if we do, what should we do?</p> <p>We stand by our view that the next bear market will be triggered by an expectation of the end of the business cycle. We may now be late cycle, and the end may now be sooner than many had expected, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it is imminent. So, with the global economy broadly strong, and many companies delivering robust earnings, we think this is a buying opportunity.</p> <p>These periods of correction and uncertainty are not pleasant but they should not be seen as unusual.

In these cases, firms also lacked a robust and comprehensive governance framework.</p> <p>Additionally, firms need to do more work to identify and reduce potential conduct risks created by their algorithmic trading strategies.

                "bodyText":"After a week which saw some $4tn wiped off the value of global stock markets, there is a better mood among investors at the moment. European markets have moved higher, with the FTSE 100 up 1.3% , Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax 1.7% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbing 1.5%. In early trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 292 points or 1.2%, even as US bond prices continue to fall. But analysts expect continued volatilty as the week progresses, with US inflation figures on Wednesday likely to be a key indicator for the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress. Meanwhile the City watchdog has warned that firms need to do more to deal with the risks of computerised trading. Elsewhere Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said further rises in interest rates would be appropriate if the recovery in the global economy and an improving labour market continued to offset any Brexit weakness. Greece is considering more bond issues after successfully raising \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn last week. And another 4,418 jobs were saved at the collapsed contractor Carillion. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The recovery in US markets seen late on Friday is continuing as Wall Street opens, despite the continuing strength of US bond yields. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 300 points or 1.25%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up around 1%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for the US markets: Shares may be moving higher in the wake of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound on Wall Street, but US bond yields are also on the rise. Normally bond yields fall when markets rise, but 10 year US treasury yields remain at four year highs. Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: Have stocks and bond yields decoupled again? Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reversal and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish follow-through in the stock markets have not been supported by rising government bond prices. As bonds have continued to sell-off, yields have pushed further higher. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has now climbed to above 2.9% for the first time since early 2014. Should yields march further higher \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is quite possible with the upcoming US inflation and retail sales data to look forward to on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then there is a possibility the equity markets could be in for another volatile week. Indeed, we think that far too much technical damage has been incurred in the indices for the bulls to make a quick comeback and with all guns blazing...So, Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce may well prove to be a mere dead-cat bounce for stocks. Meanwhile, Greece is watching the markets carefully with an eye to launching more bond sales before its final bailout program ends in August. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After successfully raising \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn from its sale of a seven-year bond last week, Athens is now looking to complete at least two more bond sales as part of wider steps to reinforce market access and show investors it can go it alone. The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has hinted that future issues could include a three-year bond \u00e2\u20ac\u201c launched around the time of the March 4 general elections in Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a ten-year bond. The government has announced plans to build a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19bn cash buffer that would allow the debt stricken country to cover debt repayments once the bailout programme expires. Market turbulence in the form of more corrections, however, could yet dash plans to create the safety net. Volatility in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off caused the government to delay trade of the seven -year bond by 48 hours proving that while Greece has progressed both fiscally and in terms of structural reforms it is still at risk of exogenous forces. The seven-year bond was sold at a yield of 3.5% with UK investors leading the pack of more than 200 hedge funds, banks and fund managers who lodged bids. The stock market falls we have been seeing are not unusual but did take longer than expected to happen, says Richard Stammers, investment strategist at European Wealth Group. And things are likely to remain volatile, he says: We expect the short term to remain bumpy - possibly very bumpy. The definition of a correction is 10% off from the recent high and of a bear market, 20% off from the year high. So, whilst we are not in bear market territory, we need to recognise for every short term bounce there could be an equal and opposite slide back. Could we see lows of 15%? Quite possibly so, if we do, what should we do? We stand by our view that the next bear market will be triggered by an expectation of the end of the business cycle. We may now be late cycle, and the end may now be sooner than many had expected, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it is imminent. So, with the global economy broadly strong, and many companies delivering robust earnings, we think this is a buying opportunity. These periods of correction and uncertainty are not pleasant but they should not be seen as unusual. What was unusual was that it took so long to happen. Here is Reuters on the interest rate comments from Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe: Vlieghe said on Monday that a further rise in British interest rates was likely to be appropriate if a strong global economy and a labour market pick-up continued to offset Brexit headwinds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A further rise in interest rates is likely to be appropriate if all those trends continue and we are on a trajectory. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just one hike in November and then we take a very long break,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said at a panel discussion hosted by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank. The central banker also said the level of interest rates that the BoE needs to reach before it starts to reverse its quantitative easing programme could come under review. Previously the BoE has said rates would need to reach around 2 percent before it started to sell its 435 billion pounds ($603 billion) of government bonds, in order to give headroom for future rate cuts during a downturn. Vlieghe said that since then the BoE had found it could cut rates below 0.5 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing experience selling debt holdings would also influence the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on when to start to sell assets, he said. Another 4,418 jobs at collapsed Carillion have been saved, says the Official Receiver. The staff involved are at prison facilities management, defence bases catering, and cleaning services. So far around a third of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff have had their employment confirmed. In this latest announcement, the receiver said employment for 59 staff working on paused construction projects could not be secured and they would leave the business. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB, said: MPC voting member Gertjan Vlieghe has been speaking this morning on a panel discussing household debt in London and remarks such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is increased evidence that tighter labour markets are beginning to have upwards effect on wages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if there is less credit headwind to the UK economy then we maybe ready for rate hikes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are certainly erring on the side of being hawkish. The comments are even more noteworthy given that Mr Vlieghe is deemed one of the most dovish voting members. More from my colleague Richard Partington who is listening to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gertjan Vlieghe speak at the Resolution Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt conference: (for disruption, read situation - the perils of autocorrect!) City firms need to do more to mitigate the risks of algorithmic trading, according to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog. Automated trading was suggested as on of the causes of the recent stock market turmoil, with computerised selling accelarating as share prices tumbled. In a new report the Financial Conduct Authority says: Automated technology brings significant benefits to investors, including increased execution speed and reduced costs. However, it can also amplify certain risks. It is essential that key oversight functions, including compliance and risk management, keep pace with technological advancements. In the absence of appropriate systems and controls, the increased speed and complexity of financial markets can turn otherwise manageable errors into extreme events with potentially wide-spread implications. As a result, algorithmic trading continues to be an area of focus for the FCA and other regulators across the globe. In general, we are encouraged that firms have taken steps to reduce risks inherent to algorithmic trading. However, further improvement is needed in a number of areas. For example, some firms lacked a suitable process to identify algorithmic trading across their business and did not have appropriate documentation in place to demonstrate suitable development and testing procedures are maintained. In these cases, firms also lacked a robust and comprehensive governance framework. Additionally, firms need to do more work to identify and reduce potential conduct risks created by their algorithmic trading strategies. This includes delivering suitable market abuse training for staff involved in the development and implementation processes. Firms also need to consider the potential impact their algorithmic trading activity (including the combined impact of multiple algorithmic strategies) may have on the fair and effective operation of financial markets. We will continue to assess whether firms have taken sufficient steps to reduce risks arising from algorithmic trading. Vlieghe says there is increased evidence that tight labour markets are beginning to have an upward effect on wages [another reason for a possible rise in rates]. He adds: The Resolution Foundation is holding a seminar on household debt at the moment, with speakers including the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gertjan Vlieghe: The removal of some of the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent complacency is no bad thing, says Joseph Amato at investment management group Neuberger Berman: Before last week, the last meaningful market correction took place in 2016, when investors were concerned about the potential for a US recession, a China hard landing and low oil prices. But weakness was short-lived and markets have generally advanced since then. The most recent pullback seems to have been triggered by the 2.9% wage inflation reading in the US and resulting fears the Fed would accelerate interest rate increases. But the loss was exacerbated by excessive investor complacency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that has clearly been removed over the past week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as technical factors. This removal of complacency is a healthy development, as is the reduction in equity valuations... We do not expect an immediate resolution of market technical quirks or an end to concerns about the pace of central bank rate hikes. It is possible market volatility could have a negative impact on the real economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c undermining the so-called wealth effect and consumer confidence, and substantially widening credit spreads. However, there is little current indication anything like that is taking place. In fact, global economies continue to show exceptional strength \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that should be a key driver of markets in the coming months. Robert Lea, head of global equity research at Ashburton Investments also expects markets to climb this year, albeit at a slower rate: On balance, we still expect global equity markets to rise this year. However, we expect the rate of increase to moderate. The risk of an outright bear market remains low, as bear markets normally coincide with recessions. We see a low risk of recession currently and expect growth in the global economy to continue gathering momentum. However, we continue to think the market has under-estimated the scope for a rise in inflation this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both in the US and globally. We also think the market has potentially misjudged the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to normalise interest rate policy. That said, rates should likely remain low, in absolute and historical terms. The Vix volatility index, which had been pretty dormant for several months before surging last week, has slipped back this morning. It hit as high as 50 last week but is now down 10% at 26 as some calm returns. One of the sparks for the recent sell-off was the stronger than expected growth in US wages, which led to speculation that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more often than previously expected. So one of the key events this week is likely to be the latest US inflation data, which could go some way to either easing or confirming those concerns. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor: Investors are breathing a sigh of relief after the torrid times last week, with European equity markets rallying this morning. Buying the dip has been a very difficult call in recent days, with every attempt at engagement punished in subsequent market moves, so investors will be hoping that this is a genuine buying opportunity. The key event of the week is US Consumer Price data on Wednesday, with investors anxious to determine whether the inflation fears that have helped to drive recent market moves have been overdone or if these concerns are justified. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Derek Halpenny said: A softer print on Wednesday would go some way to easing current investor fears. Wage inflation did not emerge in 2017 and even if you believe the data last week is a sign of things to come, usual lags mean this will not be evident in consumer prices until toward year-end or even into 2019. We suspect that investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fears over inflation should subside over the coming weeks, which will help to stabilise equity markets, long-term yields and bring levels of volatility back down. But after the scale of this equity price correction, investors are likely to remain defensive this week. Even a slight upward surprise in the inflation data could be enough to warrant a further sell-off. One of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest advertisers is warning it might take action against tech companies over online harassment, hate speech and other issues: The consumer goods multinational Unilever is threatening to withdraw its advertising from online platforms such as Facebook and Google if they fail to protect children, promote hate or create division in society. In a speech later today, Keith Weed, the Unilever chief marketing officer, will say that, as a brand-led business, Unilever \u00e2\u20ac\u0153needs its consumers to have trust in our brands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Unilever is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest marketing spender, after Procter &amp; Gamble, and spent \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.7bn (\u00c2\u00a36.8bn) last year advertising its brands, which include PG Tips, Marmite, Dove and Persil. The company has trimmed its ad production as part of a cost-saving drive; it is making fewer TV ads and has halved the number of ad agencies it uses to 1,500. Our full report is here: European markets are holding on to their early gains, and with US futures suggesting a positive open on Wall Street, there is some cautious optimism around. But Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, warned: As proven time and again, these things can turn on a dime, and it is way, way too early to treat the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial growth with anything but caution. Still, the FTSE climbed more than 1% after the bell, taking it towards 7170, with the CAC up 1.2% and the DAX leading the charge thanks to a near 1.7% surge, one that leaves the German index back above 12300. Importantly the Dow Jones currently looks set to follow in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s footsteps, with the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s futures pointing to a 170 point rise later this afternoon. The forex markets were slightly more subdued. Both the pound and euro tried to claw back some of their recent losses against the dollar; the former rose 0.2%, but is still the wrong side of $1.385, while the latter jumped 0.3% to tease $1.227. Against each other, meanwhile, there was nothing to separate the two, with sterling flat around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.128. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really that much for investors to work with this Monday, with the focus likely on Tuesday and Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potentially week-defining UK and US inflation readings. As forecast, European markets are benefitting from the rebound on Wall Street and have started the week on a brighter note after the recent turmoil. The FTSE 100 is up 0.8% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 1% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.9%. With the prospect of rising UK interest rates, Brexit concerns, and the continuing squeeze on real wages, UK consumers appeared to have kept their money in their pockets last month, according to a Visa survey. Reuters has the details: British shoppers spent less last month than the year before, causing spending in January to fall for the first time since 2013, according to a survey which underscored many households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 caution about their finances and the approach of Brexit. Visa, whose debit and credit cards are used for a third of payments in Britain, said on Monday that consumers stayed away from the traditional post-Christmas sales last month. Household spending fell by 1.2 percent in January compared with the same month in 2017, with spending in shops down by 4 percent, it said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer spending entered the new year on a downbeat note, falling for the eighth time in the past nine months, as Britons continued to cut back on spending,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Visa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief commercial officer, Mark Antipof, said. A fall in car sales weighed on the overall sales figures too. But there was better news for hotels and restaurants - as well as for hair salons and sellers of beauty products, as consumers looked for small treats for themselves. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy lagged behind stronger growth in other rich nations in 2017 as higher inflation since the Brexit vote and slow wage growth pinched consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending power. Annabel Fiddes, an economist at financial data firm IHS Markit which produces the survey for Visa, said concerns about Brexit were weighing on consumer confidence. But spending could pick up later this year as inflation is expected to fall back while wages rise more quickly, she added. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market turmoil, which saw Wall Street enter correction territory (losing 10% from its recent peak) and some $4trn wiped off global share values, investors will be hoping for some respite this morning. And after US markets staged a later rally on Friday and some positive moves in Asia, Europe is expected to open higher: But that does not necessarily mean everything is now hunky dory. For a start the recent rise in bond yields - one of the factors behind the sudden turn in sentiment - may not be over yet. Central banks will continue to withdraw the stimulus measures which have supported the market since the financial crisis, which in turn will put pressure on bonds.

How this plays out over the coming days depends on whether the rebound we saw on Friday can translate into some form of base for a continuation of the uptrend that has been in place for the last nine years. This may well depend on whether we see further increases in bond yields, or a rise in interest rate expectations from other central banks around the world. ..There are other concerns, US margin debt still remains near record levels and the prospect of further losses, combined with the prospect of higher rates could prompt further jitters, not to mention the untried reaction function of a whole new breed of equity investors and traders who have never experienced the type of volatility that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone through over the last few days. It is true that economic fundamentals remain fairly solid but it is also important to remember that this is already probably priced into US equities already, given that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now seen tax reform get passed, along with a new US budget, which in itself is likely to see bond prices come under further pressure. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen a raft of US companies announce significant increases in salaries and bonuses and this was followed last week, with the news that German metal workers won a 4.3% wage rise, a trend that looks set to be replicated across the world, as governments urge employers to increase minimum salaries to more acceptable levels. And the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest hedge fund is predicting that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bigger shakeout\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is coming. Echoing the complacency theme, Bob Prince, co-chief investment officer at the $160bn US hedge fund Bridgewater, told the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3): There had been a lot of complacency built up in markets over a long time, so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this shakeout will be over in a matter of days. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably have a much bigger shakeout coming. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on his comments, with an update on Asian markets: Otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly quiet on the economic and corporate front, although Bank of England MPC member Jan Vlieghe is speaking later this morning.",

Despite the unchanged inflation figure of 3% - rather than the expected dip - an imminent UK interest rate rise is not necessarily a done deal, says Forex.com market analyst Fawad Razaqzada:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound staged a small rally after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s publication of the latest UK inflation figures, before giving back a sizeable chunk of its gains against the dollar. It actually turned negative against the euro and yen, though it was holding its own better against commodity currencies...Overall inflation rose more than expected, and the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial response was a swift rally. However sterling came off its best levels around midday as traders who bought the news, took profit.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the Bank of England will probably not be surprised by the outcome of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures after it predicted that CPI will remain elevated and that it intends to combat this by raising interest rates earlier and faster than previously expected. But is the BoE correct in its projections? Can they be trusted?</p> <p>While inflation could easily rise further, one has to consider the alternative scenario too. After all, the impact of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post declines has fallen away. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, crude oil prices have been falling of late, with both Brent and WTI recently turning negative on the year. If oil prices fall further then this may be reflected in lower fuel and energy prices, and hopefully lower inflation. Given the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the BoE would favour not having to hike rates if inflation were to fall back. So, an imminent rate hike is not a done deal by any means. </p> <p>Still, the BoE has definitely dropped its dovish bias and the next change in interest rates will most likely be a raise than a cut. So, there is a possibility we may see the pound drift higher in the coming months. If sterling were to shine, its best bet would be against a non-US dollar currency, as the greenback has been on a good run of form against most currencies of late.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a82ec52e4b03213d18fb408\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-13T13:51:08.217Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the concerns driving the recent turmoil in the markets was a rise in inflation and the subsequent belief that central banks might start raising interests rates more quickly than expected.</p> <p>But Capital Economics believes that inflation may not rise very far. Chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a start, underlying inflation has remained low and stable recently. Core inflation in the OECD was 1.9% in December. Moreover, it has been between 1.5% and 2.0% for the past six years, and 1.1% and 2.5% since 2003. The stability of underlying inflation for most of this century suggests that only a huge economic shock, or major structural change, would dislodge it far from the typical 2% target.</p> <p>Of course, the average inflation rate can mask big variations between countries. But even in economies which are closest to full employment, inflation has remained low. In Japan, where the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1993, inflation excluding fresh food and energy is only 0.3%. And in Germany, the unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1980 but core inflation is just 1.5%. </p> <p>Second, wage inflation is not rising very rapidly. We do expect average earnings growth in the US to trend up this year but the jump to 2.9% y/y in January, which triggered the market sell-off, was exacerbated by temporary weather patterns and may be reversed. Fears that trade union demands will push Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate up sharply look misplaced. (See our European Economic Update, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153German pay demands won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see inflation surge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, 30th January.) And elsewhere in the euro-zone, wage pressures are much weaker. </p> <p>Third, inflation expectations remain low. For the euro-zone and the US, measures of expected inflation between five and ten years in the future derived from financial markets are still below their post-crisis average. And while the University of Michigan measure of household inflation expectations in the US edged up to 2.5% in January, this is still below its average level since the financial crisis. </p> <p>Finally, the inflationary impact of higher oil prices is likely to fade in the coming months.

though he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also aiming to cut welfare spending. </p> <p>And looking further ahead, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no expectation of a balanced budget in the next decade, due to Trump tax

                "bodyText":"Despite an opening fall on Wall Street after two trading days of recovery, markets in Europe had a fairly calm session. With the euro gaining some ground against a weaker dollar, they ended slightly down on the day but there was by no means any sustained burst of selling. Italy was among the worst performers, as investors started to fret about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forthcoming election. In the UK investors shrugged off the higher than expected inflation figures, which gave some credence of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hints of rising interest rates. In the US, investors decided to take some profits ahead of the key inflation figures due on Wednesday. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 9.05 points or 0.13% lower at 7168.01 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.7% to 12,196.50 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.6% at 5109.24 italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.35% to 22,034.42 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.23% lower at 9650.7 In Greece, the Athens market edged down 0.2% to 821.85 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 111 points or 0.45%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. As US interest rates do go up, it will put more pressure on households who have borrowed heavily. And the latest figures show an increase in debt, up $193bill to $13.15tn in the three months to December compared to the previous quarter. The figure was $402bn higher than the same time in 2016. The increase was driven by a rise in mortgage loans. The markets have dealt fairly well with the stronger than expected UK inflation figures, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: Though the global indices are broadly negative, the markets haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coped too badly with a pretty damn hawkish UK CPI reading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be interesting to see if investors have the same kind of reaction to tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US figures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after all, it was fears that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation would continue to creep higher that helped spark the recent market bloodbath. Meanwhile in Cyprus it has been announced that finance minister Harris Georgiades, much plaudited for masterminding the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery, will retain his position in a new government unveiled today. Helena Smith reports: The news will go down well in Brussels. Georgiades is feted for almost single handedly overseeing Cyprus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 extraordinary return to growth after it was bailed out to the tune of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn during its banking crisis five years ago. The island, which exited its bailout programme ahead of schedule in March 2016 following stringent implementation of reforms, was one of the fastest growing economies in the euro area with a growth rate of 3.8 % in 2017. At 7.4 % it also registered the biggest year-on-year drop in government debt. But challenges still lie ahead: the island has one of the highest bank stocks of non-performing loans which, increasingly, has been cause for alarm in Brussels. President Nicos Anastasiades, re-elected to a second five year term in office ten days ago, may well have held onto him in the knowledge that the 45-year-old economist will rise to the challenge of restructuring the bad debt. New Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the global economy has recovered strongly since the financial crisis, but the bank remained alert to any risks to stability. In opening remarks at his swearing in ceremony, he said: We are in the process of gradually normalizing both interest rate policy and our balance sheet with a view to extending the recovery and sustaining the pursuit of our objectives. We will also preserve the essential gains in financial regulation while seeking to ensure that our policies are as efficient as possible. We will remain alert to any developing risks to financial stability. European markets appear relatively untroubled by the falls in the US, which seem fairly contained so far. The FTSE 100 is off its best levels and is virtually flat on the day, but Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac have recovered from the worst of their earlier losses and around both down around 0.3%. After two days of recovery, US markets are falling back again at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 95 points or 0.4% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.5% lower. The dips come ahead of consumer price data due on Wednesday, which will reinforce talk of interest rate rises if the figures come in stronger than expected. David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX, said: Headline CPI (including food and energy) came in at +2.2% in November but slipped back to 2.1% in December. Investors are hoping for further evidence that inflation has topped out for now. If so, and we see another modest reduction to 2.0% then this should be enough to push bond yields down and equities up. But in the current environment we can expect US Treasury yields to soar if January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number were to come in at 2.1% or higher. This would be a problem as the key 10-year Treasury note yield is dangerously close to testing 3.0% - a four-year high, increasing fears that the 35-year bond bull market is finally over. This would signal higher borrowing costs to come which would not be good for global equities. Earlier Cleveland Federal Reserve president Loretta Mester said the recent stock market sell-off would not damage the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong prospects. She added that inflation was expected to rise towards the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target over time, but not so fast the Fed needed to increase rates more quickly. The pound has come off its best levels against the dollar. After hitting a high of $1.3923 following the stronger than expected inflation figures, it has now drifted back to $1.3874, a 0.3% gain on the day. Despite the unchanged inflation figure of 3% - rather than the expected dip - an imminent UK interest rate rise is not necessarily a done deal, says Forex.com market analyst Fawad Razaqzada: The pound staged a small rally after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s publication of the latest UK inflation figures, before giving back a sizeable chunk of its gains against the dollar. It actually turned negative against the euro and yen, though it was holding its own better against commodity currencies...Overall inflation rose more than expected, and the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial response was a swift rally. However sterling came off its best levels around midday as traders who bought the news, took profit. It is worth noting that the Bank of England will probably not be surprised by the outcome of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures after it predicted that CPI will remain elevated and that it intends to combat this by raising interest rates earlier and faster than previously expected. But is the BoE correct in its projections? Can they be trusted? While inflation could easily rise further, one has to consider the alternative scenario too. After all, the impact of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post declines has fallen away. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, crude oil prices have been falling of late, with both Brent and WTI recently turning negative on the year. If oil prices fall further then this may be reflected in lower fuel and energy prices, and hopefully lower inflation. Given the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the BoE would favour not having to hike rates if inflation were to fall back. So, an imminent rate hike is not a done deal by any means. Still, the BoE has definitely dropped its dovish bias and the next change in interest rates will most likely be a raise than a cut. So, there is a possibility we may see the pound drift higher in the coming months. If sterling were to shine, its best bet would be against a non-US dollar currency, as the greenback has been on a good run of form against most currencies of late. One of the concerns driving the recent turmoil in the markets was a rise in inflation and the subsequent belief that central banks might start raising interests rates more quickly than expected. But Capital Economics believes that inflation may not rise very far. Chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said: For a start, underlying inflation has remained low and stable recently. Core inflation in the OECD was 1.9% in December. Moreover, it has been between 1.5% and 2.0% for the past six years, and 1.1% and 2.5% since 2003. The stability of underlying inflation for most of this century suggests that only a huge economic shock, or major structural change, would dislodge it far from the typical 2% target. Of course, the average inflation rate can mask big variations between countries. But even in economies which are closest to full employment, inflation has remained low. In Japan, where the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1993, inflation excluding fresh food and energy is only 0.3%. And in Germany, the unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1980 but core inflation is just 1.5%. Second, wage inflation is not rising very rapidly. We do expect average earnings growth in the US to trend up this year but the jump to 2.9% y/y in January, which triggered the market sell-off, was exacerbated by temporary weather patterns and may be reversed. Fears that trade union demands will push Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate up sharply look misplaced. (See our European Economic Update, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153German pay demands won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see inflation surge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, 30th January.) And elsewhere in the euro-zone, wage pressures are much weaker. Third, inflation expectations remain low. For the euro-zone and the US, measures of expected inflation between five and ten years in the future derived from financial markets are still below their post-crisis average. And while the University of Michigan measure of household inflation expectations in the US edged up to 2.5% in January, this is still below its average level since the financial crisis. Finally, the inflationary impact of higher oil prices is likely to fade in the coming months. Indeed, if we are right in expecting Brent crude prices to decline, energy price inflation will turn negative next year. He concludes: The big picture is that global inflation is edging up, not taking off. The upshot is that while interest rates are likely to rise gradually over the next year or two, there is no need to panic. We expect government bond yields to rise, but remain very low by historical standards, with ten-year US Treasury yields, for example, unlikely to get much higher than 3% by the end of this year. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is holding onto its earlier gains, and so is the pound. The FTSE 100 is currently up 20 points, or 0.3%, on top of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.2% jump. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite the pound gaining half a cent against the US dollar following the inflation figures (a strong sterling is usually bad for shares). Mining companies are leading the rally, as the weaker US dollar pushes up commodity prices, along with holiday companies after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent results from TUI. This follows a strong day on Wall Street yesterday, and gains across most of Asia earlier on Tuesday. However, European stocks are being dragged down by the strengthening euro (the dollar is getting a kicking generally today). The US stock market opens in just over an hour, and is expected to dip.... In other news (which I missed earlier), UK house prices are rising faster than wages or the headline inflation rate. Average house prices in the UK rose by 5.2% in the year to December 2017, up from 5.0% in November 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice as fast as earnings, underlining how hard it is to get onto the property ladder (even though price rises have slowed). London was the slowest part of the housing market, with prices only rising by 2.5% over the last year. However, that still leaves the average house in the capital at \u00c2\u00a3484,000 - more than double the UK average of \u00c2\u00a3227,000. Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management, is hopeful that inflation might fall this month: He explains: January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures exclude the full effect of the recent market shake out, a subsequent decline in oil prices and weaker sterling against the dollar. It could easily be that inflation drops back in February, something that would take the pressure off of rates. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at thinktank NIESR, predicts that UK interest rates will rise in May (probably from 0.5% to 0.75%).....and keep rising over the next couple of years: Kara says: UK January CPI inflation was unchanged at 3.0%. Inflation has likely peaked and is set to return to the target rate of 2.0% over the next eight quarters. Our forecast assumes a rate increase by the MPC in May and every 6 months after that until it reaches 2%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In historical terms, that would be a relatively low cost of borrowing (UK interest rates averaged 5% before the financial crisis). But it could still put some families in a very tough spot - especially as wages are being eroded by inflation Jane Tully, director of external affairs at the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, is worried, saying: Inflation remains high at three percent with wages not keeping pace, and for the thousands of people we hear from each week at National Debtline, meeting day-to-day costs, such as energy, water and council tax continues to be a challenge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent research shows that as many as half of all low income households are already struggling. We are concerned that the slightest change in circumstances, such as a further interest rate rise, could push many of these households into further difficulty. At 3%, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer prices index is close to the six-year high of 3.1% struck in November. And inflation is becoming an increasingly home-grown problem, rather than simply being driven by higher import costs. Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Contrary to expectations, inflation held steady on last month, meaning households will have to wait until later in 2018 for expected falls to materialise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the drivers of inflation are changing. While the price of oil is something to watch in future as it pushes up input prices for UK manufacturers, the effect of the post-Brexit pound devaluation is waning slightly with items that are less import-intensive driving the recent rise ininflation. Prices of recreational and cultural goods, such as trips to the cinema, rose at their fastest rate for 8 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Brexit continues to dominate the headlines, looking forward we need to be paying more attention to domestic cost pressures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy breakdown of the factors pushing inflation up: [Eagle-eyed readers will note that Resolution are using \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCPIH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, a measure of inflation which includes owner occupiers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 housing costs. It stuck at 2.7% in January] Bad news for UK households: economists expect UK inflation to only fall slowly during 2018. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, fears that the real wage squeeze will continue for most of this year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation remained stuck at 3% in January, still well above earnings growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do expect inflation to fall back gradually over the course of the year, but this will be a slow process given that global commodity prices have generally been on an upward trend in recent months. The squeeze on real earnings may therefore persist until late in 2018, which will continue to dampen consumer spending growth this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Inflation has been running ahead of wages since the start of 2017, as this chart shows: If wages do start rising, the Bank of England will face more pressure to raise interest rates. That would be a blow to indebted families who are already struggling to handle their debts. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: Economists have been expecting inflation to gradually fall back to the 2% target over the coming year or so, starting today with a drop to 2.9%. But in fact the rate remained at 3.0%, with price rises driven by clothing, footwear and recreational goods/services. Inflation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now been above target for 12 straight months. This adds further weight to the case for higher interest rates sooner rather than later. Indeed Bank of England policymakers said last week they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try and bring inflation back to target more quickly than previously expected, which means rates could rise faster and further than anticipated. The news that recreational costs (such as zoo and parks) prevented inflation falling last month has caused a bit of a stir in the City. James Smith of ING bank predicts that this trend won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last: Core inflation rose more than expected to 2.7%, as recreation prices fell considerably less rapidly than would be seasonally expected at the start of the year. Some of this is reportedly down to entrance fees at zoos and gardens, but given that much of the recreation category (things like computers and TVs) is fairly sterling-sensitive, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this resilience to last. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the sharp fall in the pound after the Brexit vote has now more-or-less fed through to consumer prices and the rate of pass-through is starting to ease. The recent sterling strength will only accelerate this process. Encouragingly for consumers, the prices charged by UK factories rose at a slower rate in January. The annual producer price inflation rate dipped to 4.7%, down from 5.4% in December. That suggests that the impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit-vote slump may be fading. The ONS says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Factory goods price inflation continued to slow, with food prices falling in January. The growth in the cost of raw materials also slowed, with the prices of some imported materials falling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With inflation stuck at 3%, British workers are still suffering a cost of living squeeze. Average wages only rose by 2.4% per year in the three months to November (the most recent figures), or by 2.5% if you include bonuses. So in practice, wages are shrinking by around 0.5% to 0.6%. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the government needs to act - by raising wages for the lowest paid, and pumping more money into infrastructure projects. She warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation is still outpacing wages and working people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards are falling fast. The government can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep on standing by and doing nothing. A plan to boost wages is urgently needed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector workers must get a proper pay rise. The minimum wage must go up to \u00c2\u00a310 as quickly as possible. And the Chancellor must boost infrastructure spending in his spring statement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this would help counter the loss of confidence in the economy caused by Brexit uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Treasury, though, tweets that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing its bit... The Bank of England is charged with keeping Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate close to 2%, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data show it has a lot more work to do. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no breathing space for Mark Carney and the Bank of England who continue to battle with high inflation, though at least that figure has steadied and not risen further. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite many expecting the figure to drop, inflation remains at 3%, sitting way above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target, though policy makers will at least be pleased to see producer prices fall back. So could the Bank raise interest rates soon, as it hinted last week? Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, says a May interest rate hike is certainly possible - although he thinks Carney and co will hold off.... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number will keep the May Bank of England meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for an interest rate hike. We think that this is still too early for a hike as caveats on Brexit and the sustainability of growth remain but as we heard last Thursday, the sticky inflation picture is putting gradual but sooner increases in the base rate into more people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central scenarios of what happens in the UK in 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has jumped on the back of the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate was higher than expected last month. Sterling gained half a cent to $1.39, as traders calculated that it makes an early interest rate rise more likely. UK food prices fell between December and January (which makes sense, as people tighten their belts after the Christmas festivities). The ONS says: This effect came from prices for a wide range of types of food and drink, with the largest contribution coming from a fall in meat prices. However, prices are still higher than a year ago, as these charts show: The Office for National Statistics says that petrol prices had a downward impact on inflation....but recreational activities kept the cost of living up. It says: The largest downward contribution to change in the rate came from prices for motor fuels, which rose by less than they did a year ago. The main upward effect came from prices for a range of recreational and cultural goods and services, in particular, admissions to attractions such as zoos and gardens, for which prices fell by less than they did a year ago. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remained at 3% in January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than the 2.9% that the City had expected, and means the cost of living squeeze continues. More to follow... The MSCI world stock market index has recovered a small slice of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thanks to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally on Wall Street, followed by the gains in most of Asia today. The US dollar has weakened after the US government outlined its 2019 budget last night - showing whopping deficits in the years ahead. Under Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new $4.4 trillion budget plan, the US federal deficit would hit around $1 trillion next year - even though he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also aiming to cut welfare spending. And looking further ahead, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no expectation of a balanced budget in the next decade, due to Trump tax cuts and his plans to to hike military spending. This splurge of borrowing - if approved by Congress - would push America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt to fresh record highs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget for the upcoming fiscal year calls for steep cuts to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social safety net and mounting spending on the military. That combination in the $4.4 trn budget plan submitted Monday to Congress steps far back from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises last year to balance the federal budget. If enacted, his plan would establish annual $1 trillion-plus deficits, a major reversal for Republicans who objected to increased spending during the Obama administration. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget revives his calls for big cuts to domestic programs that benefit the poor and middle class, such as food stamps, housing subsidies and student loans. Retirement benefits would remain mostly untouched, as Trump has pledged, though Medicare providers would absorb about $500bn in cuts a nearly 6 percent reduction. Asian stock markets have closed with gains across the board...apart from Japan, where the stronger yen pulled the Nikkei down. European stock markets are being held back today by the weakness of the US dollar. The euro has gained 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.232, which (as in Japan) has a negative impact on shares. So while London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market is slightly higher, the main European indices are dipping a little. Investec economist Victoria Clarke predicts that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate held steady at 3% las month - dashing hopes of a fall to 2.9% She writes: We expect CPI inflation to trend lower over the year ahead, although it may be a slow creep. Indeed, we are pencilling in a steady 3.0% in January. Clarke reckons that air fares fell less in January than a year ago; meaning they applied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some upward pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the 12-month inflation rate. But food and fuel may have risen slower, she adds: We expect this to be more than offset by drags from elsewhere in the wider transport category, given that the rise in petrol prices looks set to be notably less than in January 2017. Another negative influence is the food price category. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is gaining a little ground in early trading. FTSE 100 has risen by 17 points at the open, sending the blue-chip index up 0.22% to 7191. Holiday group TUI is the biggest riser, up 2.5%, after reporting an 8% rise in turnover in the last quarter and a smaller net loss. TUI says sales of summer holidays for 2018 has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153started well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Demand remains strong for the Western Mediterranean and Caribbean (despite hurricane disruption and reflecting demand from North America) and continues to improve for Turkey and North Africa. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coming to the party, though. The Nikkei fell 0.7% today to 21,244.68. The selloff came as the yen hit a five-month high against the US dollar, which hurts Japanese exporters. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market helped led the recovery in Asia today, with South Korea and Hong Kong close behind. The benchmark Chinese index, the CSI 300, has gained almost 1.2% in late trading. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kospi 200 is up 0.9%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng has gained 1.3%. while Australia is up a more modest 0.6%. But this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the recent phase of volatility is over, as Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities explains: What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing right now is a continuation from Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish session that allowed the global stock markets to breathe a bit easier and with bond yields retreating slightly from their recent highs equity traders are looking for bargains. Nevertheless, it is still too early to suggest that the correction that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve witnessed since the beginning of the month is over. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil, a degree of calm has returned to the financial world. Most Asian stock markets are rallying today, after a strong performance on Wall Street last night which saw the Dow jumping 410 points. With fears of a crash fading, investors can indulge in one of their favourite pastimes - trying to bag a bargain. As Jim Fong, portfolio manager at Oceanwide Asset Management Ltd, puts it: (via Marketwatch) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a golden opportunity to accumulate some good, quality stocks. European markets are expected to open calmly; a change for traders who have watched the major indices swing violently in recent days. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Overnight the Dow had its best session in two years jumping over 400 points. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say that whilst volatility has eased up from the 1000 plus swings last week, these are still much more volatile sessions than what we are used to. The impressive rally on Wall Street spilled across into Asian markets, which posted healthy gains across the session. Unsurprisingly European bourses look set to follow suit and push on higher at the open. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the opening calls for Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major stock markets: UK FTSE to open 7 points higher at 7184 German DAX to open 26 points higher at 12,308 French CAC to open 12 points higher at 5152 But the mood in the City could change when the latest UK inflation figures are released this morning. The Consumer Prices Index is expected to fall to 2.9% in January, down from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3%. But, given the strength of the oil price, some City economists doubt whether inflation has started falling yet. Royal Bank of Canada say: With the oil price having risen significantly in recent months it now looks more likely that CPI inflation will be relatively slow to fall in 2018 even though the impact of previous exchange rate depreciation starts to fade. A high inflation reading puts more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates soon - as it threatened last week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 9.30am GMT: UK Consumer Price Index figures for January 9.30am GMT: UK house price data for December",

Inflation rates have held steady at 2.1% for annual headline consumer price inflation and 1.8% for ex food &amp; energy, rather than fall to 1.9% and 1.7% respectively as the consensus had predicted. Meanwhile retail sales were far softer than expected, falling 0.3%MoM versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise.</p> <p>Starting with inflation, the main surprise came in apparel, which rose 1.7%MoM. We had suspected it would rebound at some point given its very soft run, but not quite as quickly (it is the biggest increase in more than 10 years). Energy also rose sharply \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up 3%MoM, while medical care rose 0.4% (fastest growth for 6M).</p> <p>As for retail sales there was a wide range of forecasts (the Bloomberg survey had numbers ranging from -0.2% to +0.5%), which presumably reflected the uncertainty relating to bad weather at the very beginning of the year. We had thought there would be a switch to internet sales, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to offset the big fall in auto sales (-1.3%MoM). Building materials (-2.4%MoM), health (-1.2%) and sporting (-0.8%) were all weak, but clothing was up 1.2% and gasoline sales were up 1.6%.</p> <p>We think the softness in retail sales is temporary. With tax cuts, record low unemployment, rising wages and high confidence levels meaning the outlook for spending remains good. However, we think there could be more bad news for inflation. The dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines will gradually push up import prices, while energy costs will add to the upside. Then there are last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distortions relating to cell phone data plans dropping out of the annual comparisons from March. This on its own will add 0.2/0.3 percentage points to annual core inflation with medical care costs and housing costs pushing inflation higher too.</p> <p>In an environment of strong consumer demand, corporates have the pricing power to pass on higher costs to customers which is going to be increasingly significant given the prospect of a pick-up in wage growth. Taking this altogether we expect core inflation to be back above the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target in March with headline inflation hitting 3% by the summer. In turn this healthy growth, rising inflation environment means that we consider there to be upside risk for our call of three Fed rate hikes in 2018.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a843e9ce4b05f3d2b6e0977\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-14T13:54:00.339Z\">1.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US retail sales drop sharply</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If US inflation was higher than expected, then the retail sales figures are below forecast.</p> <p>They fell 0.3% in January, according to the Commerce Department, recording their biggest fall since February 2017.

Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rightly or wrongly, U.S. inflation data due this afternoon has come to be seen as a litmus test of whether or not economic conditions continue to support equity market advances. With few major stock indices extending their recent correction much beyond 10% from January highs, market participants are wary that any overshoot in price growth relative to expectations could upset still-fragile sentiment anew. The view is a little \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctotemic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, of course. Quite aside from the old truism around not over-emphasising one, or even a few data points, evidence linking long-term interest rates to inflation rates is notoriously sketchy, meaning markets should discount any short-term impact on rate expectations from inflation changes.</p> <p>Markets are not like that though. Any upside surprises against the 1.9% year-to-year print expected (down from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.1%), and more importantly 1.7% and 0.2% core annualised and monthly forecasts respectively, will trigger a quick re-think for risky assets. </p> <p>Potential March and May Fed rate rises have probabilities between 75%-77% according to fund futures and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now largely been priced into U.S. equities. So the focus is on whether projections of further tightening by the Fed in later months will be vindicated by economic readings in the run-up. Markets could certainly get themselves into lather on the notion that inflation greenlights the full clip of hikes the Fed has cued up</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notable that whilst the imperfect barometer of U.S. equity market anxiety, the Vix, has inevitably ebbed from spike highs notched when selling reached fever pitch, it remains within the notional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 above 20. Even if markets take signs of brewing inflation in their stride, we would not interpret the mood as having completely dispelled crisis anxieties until the Vix crosses below that marker.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a841d2de4b05f3d2b6e07a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-14T11:32:12.585Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets remain in a good mood so far today, but the real test is yet to come, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is going to be interesting to see how investors deal with the various US inflation readings this afternoon. While the headline figure is set to jump from 0.1% to 0.3%, the core number is expected to drop from 0.3% to 0.2%. </p> <p>If the focus is on the former then the markets could be in store for another interest rate-fearing freak-out; if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the latter then the global indices can breathe a (temporary) sigh of relief. Of course, this is without even considering whether or not these estimates will turn out to be accurate... </p> <p>At present the Dow Jones doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look too worried, with the futures pointing to a 130-ish point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street. That would leave the Dow not too far from 24800, its best price in around a week.</p> </blockquote> <p>To confuse things more, the year on year figures are expected to show a dip on the headline rate from 2.1% to 1.9%.

Germany and Spain maintained strong economic growth with 0.6% and 0.7% QoQ respectively, although this was slightly lower than in Q3 for both economies. Italy disappointed somewhat with just 0.3% growth and continues to lag the Eurozone average despite optimistic data released during the quarter.</p> <p>This rounds out a year in which the Eurozone economy was helped by strong tailwinds and the question is how long these growth rates can be maintained. Even though the ECB has reduced asset purchases, the euro has appreciated against the dollar and politics remains a factor of uncertainty, leading indicators are still pointing to a very strong start to the year.</p> <p>Eurozone industry is a good example of a sector with still has a lot of upside left. As manufacturing surveys have been jubilant recently, industrial production was due to surprise positively. December saw a jump to 5.2% annual growth led by capital- and durable consumer goods production. The acceleration of production growth is unlikely to be a one-off as the outlook for industry remains rosy. Manufacturing businesses are indicating that production for almost four months has been assured by current orders, which is around record highs. Growth in new orders has accelerated over the past six months, which means that expectations for production at the beginning of 2018 are high. Given the current backlog of work in industry, it is no surprise that hiring and investment in capital goods are high on the list of businesses. This adds to the strong economic picture for the start of 2018.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a840258e4b01d21b8e8afcd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-14T10:23:40.835Z\">10.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile the EY Item club has raised its forecast for UK economic growth this year from 1.4% to 1.7%.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/status/963700894645792768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our latest outlook got the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UK?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UK</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/economy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#economy</a>.

Better connectivity would help reduce regional inequalities and support growth.</li> <li><strong>Reform the education system</strong><strong>. </strong>UK students rank low on tests of basic skills, while UK firms continue reporting shortages of skilled workers, including those with technical education. Better schooling would help young people find jobs, especially once they have obtained a degree. Unemployment rates are the lowest among those with the highest levels of education.</li> <li><strong>Invest in research. </strong>Public and private spending on research and development in the UK is relatively low.

The only question is how much additional stimulus low interest rates, the strong labour market and the recent upswing of the entire Eurozone economy can still provide to the mature cycle of the German economy. In our view, still a lot. The German economy still has some upward potential as the output gap is positive but not extraordinary high compared with previous cycles, capacity utilisation is above its historical average but still lower than in 2007 and investments have only started to increase this year.

                "bodyText":"After a calm start to the day in the run-up to US inflation data, markets turned nervous again as the numbers came in much stronger than expected. The year on year headline consumer price index figure showed a rise of 2.1% for January, unchanged from December, rather than a fall of 1.9%. The news prompted renewed concerns that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than expected, despite another set of data showing disappointing US retail sales. But there was not the panic or volatility seen at times in some recent trading sessions. So on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points having lost as much as 150 points initially. European markets fell back in the immediate aftermath of the US figures but have since edged back into positive territory. The FTSE 100 is up 0.7%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.3% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.45%. Earlier eurozone industrial production beat expectations while GDP growth for the fourth quarter was in line with forecasts. In the UK, businesses expect wage settlements to pick up in 2018 according to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report. But the IMF said the UK had to do more to boost its productivity. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Wilson of Goldman Sachs Asset Management on the inflation numbers: Recent market turbulence highlights market sensitivity to firmer price and wage data, however we do not think investors should wed their investment outlook to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data alone, not least given it is clouded by methodology changes and weather-related distortions. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firmer-than-expected print, which is in some sense encouraging given it reflects a normalisation in components that have been notably weak, may extend recent market volatility, as expectations for Fed rate hikes are recalibrated higher. In our view, market-pricing for Fed policy understates the solid macro backdrop, including a 17-year low unemployment rate, and the impact of fiscal stimulus, and we think there is scope for more rate hikes this year than the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current projection for three. That said, we think today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data should viewed in conjunction with PCE inflation\u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and wages, which were the culprit for the recent volatility spike, which will be released at the start of next month. The Dow is now down 130 points but the mood seems calmer than might perhaps have been expected. The FTSE 100 has actually recovered ground after an initial slide in the immediate aftermath of the higher than forecast US inflation numbers. It is now up 40 points or 0.54%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is effectively flat, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.2%. The higher than expected inflation figures have put pressure on Wall Street in early trading, as rate hike fears resurface. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 100 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened down around 0.36%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Dow and S&amp;P500 futures tanked after the US CPI inflation numbers beat forecasts, signalling that this inflation-triggered selloff could have further to run. As previously noted there was not a huge amount of conviction in the bounce so the market is susceptible to further weakness and the inflation data is supplying plenty of reason to de-risk... Coming off the back of the 2.9% increase in average hourly earnings, this CPI print will crystallise the prevailing view in the market that we are heading for higher rates and higher inflation. Whether or not this is sustained will be proved in due course and no one can predict the trajectory of travel, or the destination, but the warning lights are flashing and equity markets are taking notice. On the other hand retail sales were dreadful. January retail sales posted the biggest decline in 11 months while most concerning of all December data was revised to show sales were flat versus the previous reading of +0.4%. Aggregate demand may not be what it seems. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most concerning about this is the risk of stagflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rising inflation and slower growth. Combined the picture is not a good one for risk today. US economist Jay Shambaugh on the inflation figures: Soft retail sales could be a temporary phenomenon but higher inflation is not, says economist James Knightley at ING Bank: The US data has provided quite a few surprises. Inflation rates have held steady at 2.1% for annual headline consumer price inflation and 1.8% for ex food &amp; energy, rather than fall to 1.9% and 1.7% respectively as the consensus had predicted. Meanwhile retail sales were far softer than expected, falling 0.3%MoM versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise. Starting with inflation, the main surprise came in apparel, which rose 1.7%MoM. We had suspected it would rebound at some point given its very soft run, but not quite as quickly (it is the biggest increase in more than 10 years). Energy also rose sharply \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up 3%MoM, while medical care rose 0.4% (fastest growth for 6M). As for retail sales there was a wide range of forecasts (the Bloomberg survey had numbers ranging from -0.2% to +0.5%), which presumably reflected the uncertainty relating to bad weather at the very beginning of the year. We had thought there would be a switch to internet sales, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to offset the big fall in auto sales (-1.3%MoM). Building materials (-2.4%MoM), health (-1.2%) and sporting (-0.8%) were all weak, but clothing was up 1.2% and gasoline sales were up 1.6%. We think the softness in retail sales is temporary. With tax cuts, record low unemployment, rising wages and high confidence levels meaning the outlook for spending remains good. However, we think there could be more bad news for inflation. The dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines will gradually push up import prices, while energy costs will add to the upside. Then there are last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distortions relating to cell phone data plans dropping out of the annual comparisons from March. This on its own will add 0.2/0.3 percentage points to annual core inflation with medical care costs and housing costs pushing inflation higher too. In an environment of strong consumer demand, corporates have the pricing power to pass on higher costs to customers which is going to be increasingly significant given the prospect of a pick-up in wage growth. Taking this altogether we expect core inflation to be back above the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target in March with headline inflation hitting 3% by the summer. In turn this healthy growth, rising inflation environment means that we consider there to be upside risk for our call of three Fed rate hikes in 2018. If US inflation was higher than expected, then the retail sales figures are below forecast. They fell 0.3% in January, according to the Commerce Department, recording their biggest fall since February 2017. Analysts had been expecting an increase of 0.2%. Meanwhile December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures were revised down from a rise of 0.4% to an unchanged reading. The poor retail sales figures contrast with the inflation figures in terms of when the Federal Reserve might take further action on interest rates. And analysts say the real key piece of data will be the February wages figures: More on the inflation figures: The higher than expected US consumer price index data has rekindled fears that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than expected, and sent another shudder through stock markets. With Treasury yields rising, share prices are again under pressure. Wall Street is now expected to open sharply lower and European markets have lost their early gains. The FTSE 100 is down a handful of points while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have gone into reverse, indicating a 200 point fall. Immediately before the inflation data, they were showing a 168 point rise. The US inflation data the market has been waiting for is out, and it has come in higher than expected. The headline figure rose by 0.5% month on month in December, compared to expectations of an increase of 0.3%. The year on year figure was steady at 2.1%, compared to forecasts of a fall to 1.9%. Markets are still holding up well ahead of the US inflation numbers, but what happens after that is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: If the numbers show stronger-than-expected readings, then this would reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will have little choice but to tighten monetary policy more aggressively. As a result, we may see renewed selling pressure coming into the bond and stock markets, while the dollar could rise against her weaker rivals. Alternatively, however, if the data releases fall significantly short of expectations, then we would expect to see the opposite happen. And finally, if the data matches expectations then it is hard to say exactly how the markets would react, although we do think that the dollar may rise anyway but not too sure about the equity and bond markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction. More on US inflation. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says: Rightly or wrongly, U.S. inflation data due this afternoon has come to be seen as a litmus test of whether or not economic conditions continue to support equity market advances. With few major stock indices extending their recent correction much beyond 10% from January highs, market participants are wary that any overshoot in price growth relative to expectations could upset still-fragile sentiment anew. The view is a little \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctotemic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, of course. Quite aside from the old truism around not over-emphasising one, or even a few data points, evidence linking long-term interest rates to inflation rates is notoriously sketchy, meaning markets should discount any short-term impact on rate expectations from inflation changes. Markets are not like that though. Any upside surprises against the 1.9% year-to-year print expected (down from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.1%), and more importantly 1.7% and 0.2% core annualised and monthly forecasts respectively, will trigger a quick re-think for risky assets. Potential March and May Fed rate rises have probabilities between 75%-77% according to fund futures and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now largely been priced into U.S. equities. So the focus is on whether projections of further tightening by the Fed in later months will be vindicated by economic readings in the run-up. Markets could certainly get themselves into lather on the notion that inflation greenlights the full clip of hikes the Fed has cued up It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notable that whilst the imperfect barometer of U.S. equity market anxiety, the Vix, has inevitably ebbed from spike highs notched when selling reached fever pitch, it remains within the notional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 above 20. Even if markets take signs of brewing inflation in their stride, we would not interpret the mood as having completely dispelled crisis anxieties until the Vix crosses below that marker. Markets remain in a good mood so far today, but the real test is yet to come, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell: It is going to be interesting to see how investors deal with the various US inflation readings this afternoon. While the headline figure is set to jump from 0.1% to 0.3%, the core number is expected to drop from 0.3% to 0.2%. If the focus is on the former then the markets could be in store for another interest rate-fearing freak-out; if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the latter then the global indices can breathe a (temporary) sigh of relief. Of course, this is without even considering whether or not these estimates will turn out to be accurate... At present the Dow Jones doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look too worried, with the futures pointing to a 130-ish point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street. That would leave the Dow not too far from 24800, its best price in around a week. To confuse things more, the year on year figures are expected to show a dip on the headline rate from 2.1% to 1.9%. The core figure, excluding food and energy, is forecast to fall from 1.8% to 1.7%. The eurozone economy is expected to remain strong after the 2017 performance, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank: Growth in the Eurozone economy was broad-based. Germany and Spain maintained strong economic growth with 0.6% and 0.7% QoQ respectively, although this was slightly lower than in Q3 for both economies. Italy disappointed somewhat with just 0.3% growth and continues to lag the Eurozone average despite optimistic data released during the quarter. This rounds out a year in which the Eurozone economy was helped by strong tailwinds and the question is how long these growth rates can be maintained. Even though the ECB has reduced asset purchases, the euro has appreciated against the dollar and politics remains a factor of uncertainty, leading indicators are still pointing to a very strong start to the year. Eurozone industry is a good example of a sector with still has a lot of upside left. As manufacturing surveys have been jubilant recently, industrial production was due to surprise positively. December saw a jump to 5.2% annual growth led by capital- and durable consumer goods production. The acceleration of production growth is unlikely to be a one-off as the outlook for industry remains rosy. Manufacturing businesses are indicating that production for almost four months has been assured by current orders, which is around record highs. Growth in new orders has accelerated over the past six months, which means that expectations for production at the beginning of 2018 are high. Given the current backlog of work in industry, it is no surprise that hiring and investment in capital goods are high on the list of businesses. This adds to the strong economic picture for the start of 2018. Meanwhile the EY Item club has raised its forecast for UK economic growth this year from 1.4% to 1.7%. More signs of the strength of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Eurozone industrial production rose by a better than expected 0.4% in December compared to the previous month, with an annual gain of 5.2%. Analysts had been forecasting rises of 0.2% and 4.2% respectively. Meanwhile the EU statistics office Eurostat confirmed that eurozone GDP rose by 2.5% in 2017, the fastest growth rate for a decade. During the fourth quarter, GDP rose by 0.6% in both the euro area and the wider European Union in the fourth quarter compared to the previous three months. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, eurozone GDP increased by 2.7% and EU GDP by 2.6%. Businesses expect average pay settlements to pick up this year, according to the latest Bank of England regional agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report. Companies think pay settlements will increase from 2.6% in 2017 to 3.1% this year, with rises broadly based across most sectors. Only construction companies expect pay rises to be flat this year. The Bank said: The survey indicated that companies expected an average pay settlement rate of 3.1% in 2018, compared with 2.6% in 2017. The 2017 outturn was higher than the 2.2% that had been expected in last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey, reflecting larger settlements across a broad range of sectors. The increases in pay settlements in 2018 are also expected to be broad-based, with only the construction sector expecting pay settlements in 2018 to be the same as in 2017. Other conclusions from the report: Growth in activity had held steady at a modest pace. Professional services firms had reported a pickup in growth; goods export volumes had strengthened, construction output growth had continued to slow. Investment intentions had remained positive, but mainly reflected investment to maintain business activity. Recruitment difficulties had remained at an elevated level Over in Italy, the latest growth figures came in slightly less than expected. Fourth quarter GDP rose by 0.3% quarter on quarter, down from the 0.4% recorded in the previous three months and expected to be repeated this time round. But over the whole of 2017, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 1.4%, the strongest performance for seven years. The IMF has some suggestions as to how the UK could improve its productivity: Build more homes, including by easing planning restrictions. Housing is very expensive in the UK. With more houses available, they would become more affordable and it would be less costly for workers to move between regions to take better-paying jobs. That would improve living standards and reduce inequality. Improve the quality of infrastructure. Transportation bottlenecks and other infrastructure problems hold back development in regions with lower productivity. Better connectivity would help reduce regional inequalities and support growth. Reform the education system. UK students rank low on tests of basic skills, while UK firms continue reporting shortages of skilled workers, including those with technical education. Better schooling would help young people find jobs, especially once they have obtained a degree. Unemployment rates are the lowest among those with the highest levels of education. Invest in research. Public and private spending on research and development in the UK is relatively low. Increasing such investments would make local companies better able to compete internationally. Britain should give priority to improving its productivity performance, according to the latest assessment from the International Monetary Fund. Following a consulation in the wake of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual health check on the UK economy when it defended its gloomy predictions for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-Brexit vote performance, the IMF said: Economic growth has moderated since the beginning of 2017, reflecting weakening domestic demand. The sharp depreciation of sterling following the referendum has raised consumer price inflation, squeezing household real income and consumption. Business investment has been constrained. In the medium term, growth is projected to remain at around 1.5 percent under the baseline assumption of continued progress in Brexit negotiations that lead to an understanding on a broad free trade agreement and on the transition process. The baseline outlook is subject to a number of risks, including developments with Brexit negotiations; uncertainty about the recovery of productivity growth, which has been weak since the crisis; and the current account deficit, which reached a record high in 2016. The IMF added: Directors agreed that structural reforms should prioritize enhancing productivity, inclusiveness, and external competitiveness... Since the financial crisis, output growth has been underpinned by strong increases in employment, while productivity growth has been very weak. With the UK unemployment rate at a 42-year low and the annual net inflow of workers from the EU already declining, the scope for future employment gains is more limited. Therefore, economic performance will depend increasingly on the ability of firms to raise output per worker. The shape of the new agreement with the EU will affect productivity performance through its implications for trade, investment and migration. The higher are any new barriers to the cross-border flow of services, goods and workers, the more negative the impact would be. European markets continue to move higher, while US futures are suggesting a positive opening on Wall Street. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of some hawkish US inflation data later this afternoon the European indices got off to a strong start this Wednesday. The FTSE, which showed some much needed resilience in the face of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own sky-high inflation figure on Tuesday, rose 40 points after the bell, allowing the index to crawl back over the 7200 mark it has struggled with in the last few sessions. It helped that the pound wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly energetic. Sterling failed to make the most out of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3.0% inflation reading, and is continuing to look out of ideas this Wednesday. Against the dollar the pound is up just 0.1%, failing to cross the $1.39 levels briefly seen on Tuesday, while against the euro it has slipped a further 0.1%, leaving it to tease a fresh one month low. After wilting in the face of the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength on Tuesday the Eurozone indices are clearly in a better mood. The DAX rose 0.6%, sending it back towards 12300, with the CAC and IBEX both climbing 0.4%. Still to come is the region-wide flash Q4 GDP reading, expected to come in unchanged from the previous estimate at 0.6%. As mentioned, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 is in the red, mainly due to continuing strength in the yen. The Japanese currency is benefiting from a weaker dollar, despite slower than expected growth. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest GDP figures showed the economy expanded by an annualised 0.5% in the three months to December, below the forecast 0.9%. After last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery on Wall Street - which was not followed up in Japan where the Nikkei 225 is in negative territory - European markets have made a bright start. The FTSE 100 is up 46 points or 0.65%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has opened 0.9% higher, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.5% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has recovered 0.7%. Among the movers in the UK market, Sky has climbed 3% after it won the bulk of the Premier League rights in the latest top flight football auction. But Galliford Try has dropped 14% as the construction group said it planned to raise \u00c2\u00a3150m from investors. It said the collapse of Carillion had increased its cash commitments on a joint venture in Aberdeen by that amount, and it did not want to divert funds from other projects to cover the payment. Meanwhile Serco has added 1% after it said it would pay \u00c2\u00a329.7m for a portfolio of health facilities management contracts from Carillion, less than the original cost of \u00c2\u00a347.7m agreed before Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation. More on the German GDP figures. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2017, in line with expectations. The figures were boosted by strong exports, according to the statistics agency, albeit growth was slower than the 0.7% recorded in the previous quarter. Over the entire year, the economy grew by 2.2%, the strongest performance since 2011. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank called it an impressive performance, but warned of the political risks ahead: The strong 4Q performance also means that without any growth in the next four quarters, annual GDP growth in 2018 would come in close to 1%. Looking ahead, the same fundamentals which have supported growth in 2016 and 2017 should still be in place in 2018. The only question is how much additional stimulus low interest rates, the strong labour market and the recent upswing of the entire Eurozone economy can still provide to the mature cycle of the German economy. In our view, still a lot. The German economy still has some upward potential as the output gap is positive but not extraordinary high compared with previous cycles, capacity utilisation is above its historical average but still lower than in 2007 and investments have only started to increase this year. Judging from previous cycles, the economy could continue its current pace for at least one or two more years, without showing signs of overheating. Obviously, there are also risks to this positive outlook for the German economy, just think of a protectionist wave coming from the US, a sharp appreciation of the euro or renewed political tensions, geopolitically, in the Eurozone or domestically. Interestingly, the last one has clearly moved up on the scale from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remote\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear possibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. ...These days, Germany clearly shows two different faces: the well-known one of a strong and high-performing economy and the unknown one of fragile politics. It looks as if in the future any German Schadenfreude on political chaos in other European countries will be very muted. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Much of the recent market turmoil came after US wages growth was stronger than expected, prompting talk of rising inflation and the prospect of central banks increasing interest rates and withdrawing financial stimulus more quickly than previously expected. With that in mind, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US consumer price index data will be closely watched to see if inflationary pressures are indeed picking up. And even though the Federal Reserve does not take much account of the CPI measure when determining interest rate policy, there is enough nervousness around that a stronger than expected figure could have repercussions for stock markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US CPI inflation report has taken on an importance all of its own in the wake of the recently strong wages numbers, never mind the fact that the Fed doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even use CPI to target inflation. Nonetheless this renewed focus on inflation, not only in the US but more globally has raised concerns that central banks may well be behind the curve when it comes to assessing the outlook for the next few months... Much importance is being attached to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US January CPI report, however it is unlikely to tell us too much more than what we already know about inflationary pressure in the US economy. Various ISM prices paid surveys are telling us that prices are rising at their highest levels since 2011, yet thus far we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen much evidence of it in the headline numbers. Even now indications are for CPI to slip back to 1.9% from 2.1%, while retail sales for January are expected to show a rise of 0.2%, a modest slowdown from the 0.4% rise seen in December. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US CPI release will be one on the most closely watched data prints in recent times. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget that the recent rout in equities started with a surprising acceleration in US earnings growth, which promoted fears that inflation may pick up soon, which in turn sent treasury yields higher. Should these fears be played out today in an unexpected strengthening in inflation, then a renewed sell off in equities and bonds could be on the cards and the dollar could benefit. With so much riding on the CPI data, we are expecting a very cautious morning of trading in general. Markets have been reasonably calm so far this week, with Wall Street recovering from early losses yesterday to end higher for the third day. Europe is expected to open higher when trading begins shortly. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls: Apart from the US data, we also have German GPD figures, which are in line with expectations, as well as eurozone growth data. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is due to release its latest assessment of the UK shortly. Agenda: 9am GMT: IMF Article IV updated assessment of UK 10am GMT: Eurozone industrial production and GDP 1.30pm GMT: US consumer price index and retail sales",

                "bodyText":"A late PS: Wall Street ended Thursday with fresh gains. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 306 points, or 1.2%, to end at 25,200. The S&amp;P also gained 1.2%, while the Nasdaq finished 1.8% higher. Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index, sums up the situation: Investors are piling back into equities after fears of higher interest rates and recent volatility have both eased. With the market showing signs of having carved out the bottom and optimism seemingly back on the agenda, bargain hunters are seeing this as a good time to jump in. And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest market report: World equity markets climbed on Wednesday as investors shrugged off the latest indication of rising U.S. inflation, while the dollar slipped to a 15-month low against the Japanese yen as strong global growth weighed on the U.S. currency. U.S. producer prices accelerated in January, according to a Labor Department report that offered further evidence that inflation pressures were building in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. The report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing a broad increase in U.S. consumer prices last month. An index of world stock markets advanced 0.8%, while major indices in Europe also rose, bolstered by strong results from heavy hitters such as Airbus, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest aerospace firm. Investors shrugged off fears of rising inflation and higher interest rates, bidding up shares of Apple Inc after Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berkshire Hathaway made the iPhone maker its top investment. Network gear maker Cisco also boosted indices on upbeat results and forecast. Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York, said he was encouraged by the reaction to the inflation data, which has overshadowed robust earnings, with about 80 percent of companies beating analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the midst of all the nervousness of the past two weeks, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re winding out a really strong earnings reporting season,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Grohowski said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There were a lot eyes fixating on the PPI number this morning, it came in a little hot. But much like yesterday, the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaking it off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And with the Dow now up a healthy 100 points, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to stop for the day. Goodbye! GW After a notably undramatic day, European stock markets have ended the day mostly higher. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the closing prices: Stoxx 600: up 1.7 points at 376.3 Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: up 20 points at 7234 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: up 7 points at 12,346 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: up 57 points at 5,219 David Madden of CMC Markets says there was a bit of profit-taking this afternoon: The FTSE 100, DAX and CAC 40 reached one week highs earlier today, but since then investors have been locking in their profits and now the FTSE 100 and DAX are in the red. The mood remains optimistic despite the small bit of selling we has seen lately. It would appears that we are slowly recovering from the major declines of last week. But...Standard Life Aberdeen had a rotten day. Its share finished down 7% as investors reacted to the loss of its biggest client, Scottish Widows. Ken Odeluga market analyst at City Index , says losing such a big client raises questions over the decision to merge Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life. Standard Life Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merger last year didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just give it an awkward name. Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that Lloyds Banking Group will pull \u00c2\u00a3109bn of asset management business reveals the cost of awkward structural problems created by Standard Life and Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tie-up last year. SLA said Lloyds accounted for less than 5% of 2017 revenues. The group could unveil turnover of \u00c2\u00a319.34bn, when it reports annual results next week. But the future hit should also include a \u00c2\u00a340m impairment charge. That means the eventual impact on SLA revenues could approach \u00c2\u00a3140m. If so, more than half of the \u00c2\u00a3200m annual cost savings the group projected from their merger would be erased. After two hours of trading, Wall Street remains up - although not by a huge amount. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both up around 0.25%, while the Nasdaq tech index has gained 0.6% (helped by Cisco). So, a calmer environment than last week. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that everything is back to normal. Lena Komileva, chief economist at (g+) economics, explains: A sliding VIX and a weak dollar have sent a much needed Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s week love letter to stocks. With the risks of a global recession and a systemic crisis low, investors sense that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s VIX jump over 50 marks the peak for now, and so the subsequent normalisation plus the monthly technical VIX expiration this week have invited algo-led trend-following strategies back into the markets. And with the VIX sliding, the need for covering short options positions (many of which have now expired) is also easing, and that is providing support for topline stock benchmarks and headline market news impulses. Thus, the pain has subsided but this is not to say that reflation and the great Fed QE unwind haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turned the dial on market risk fundamentals, at the tail end of the secular stagnation phenomenon of weak productivity, a ballooning fiscal deficit and mounting private sector debt (despite weak investment and productivity). Investors now realise that the bond cycle has turned and, in a strong growth and inflation environment, high-grade equities are a safer place to be than high-grade long bonds (hence the breakdown in correlations between bonds and stocks). US traders have joined the rally, driving shares higher and extending the recovery from last week. The Dow jumped some 215 points, with almost every company on the index gaining ground. Network equipment company Cisco is leading the charge, jumping 4.6% after beating earnings expectations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Portfolio, on the jump in US producer prices: Mark Hamrick of Bankrate.com is also concerned: Boom! US factories hiked their prices again last month, putting fresh pressure on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers to raise borrowing costs. The producer prices index rose by 0.4% during January, new figures from the Labor Department show. On an annual basis, the PPI jumped by 2.7% - up from 2.6% in December. The increase was driven by pricier gasoline, and healthcare services. Wall Street economists had only expected the annual PPI to rise by 2.5%, so this suggests inflationary pressures are building faster than expected. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly significant as we saw yesterday that consumer prices jumped by 0.5% last month. However, shares are still expected to open higher in New York in 45 minutes... Finally, the flurry of US economic data is coming through.... First up, the number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has risen to 230,000 last week, up from 223,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty low by historical standards, highlighting the strength of the US jobs market. As European traders munch into a quick lunchtime sandwich, the main indices are all up. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Buoyed by the resilience of the last few sessions the markets started to stretch their legs this Thursday, gradually clawing back some of the hefty losses seen in early February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bloodbath. The French stock market is leading the way, after new figures showed that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate fell below 9% at the end of 2017 for the first time in almost nine years. You know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quiet day when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at soybean futures. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good reason too! Soybean prices have hit their highest level since last July, due to concerns that Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crop will be disappointing. Argentina is gripped by a prolonged dry spell -- bad news for farmers in the Pampas grain belt looking to harvest their soybeans in the coming weeks. Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Tobin Gorey warns that Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soybean crops need \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soaking rain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd soon, but probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it. Weather forecasters are not expecting anything like soaking rain, nor a decline in high temperatures. We are expecting prices to gain further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The contract for soybeans to be delivered in March has jumped over $10.20 per bushel, a seven month high. Soybeans are a really important crop. They are used heavily in animal feeds, and also provide protein for use in vegetarian meals. So a jump in soybean prices can have a knock-on effect.... Volatility in the markets has fallen back today (possibly because, er..., there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great deal going on). The VIX volatility index has dropped by around 4% today to 18.5, its lowest level since shares started crashing nearly two weeks ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that investors are less nervous, having suffered a wobble last week over the prospect of interest rates being hiked to tackle inflation. Craig Erlam of City firm OANSA says: Volatility has remained quite elevated in recent sessions but we are slowly returning to more normal levels and are far from what we were experiencing last week. It would currently appear that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge was just a sharp correction in an otherwise bullish market, although it may be too soon to say that with any real confidence. Over in Greece former prime minister Antonis Samaras has announced that he has acted on his pledge to take legal action against current PM Alexis Tsipras. Samaras filed a suit against Tsipras today, accusing him of concocting what he described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrible conspiracy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of bribery claims involving the Swiss pharma giant Novartis. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In an unprecedented step, the former prime minister said he would be suing Tsipras because (he claims) it was clear the leftist-led government was bent on defaming its opponents with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aimed ultimately at dividing the Greek people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is responsible for the horrible conspiracy that is being put together,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Samaras arguing that between 2012 and 2015, his years in office, expenditure in the Greek public health sector, and on provision of drugs, had been dramatically reduced. Earlier this week, Tsipras called for a parliamentary inquiry into allegations, contained in a report compiled by anti-corruption prosecutors, that ten top former politicians, including two erstwhile premiers, had received millions of euros in bribes from Novartis in exchange for granting the company preferential treatment. Overpriced contracts in pursuit of profits at the expense of the Greek health system were among the accusations made by protected witnesses who testified before prosecutors. The state is believed to have lost as much as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4bn between 2006 and 2015 when the malpractice allegedly occurred. Samaras said the use of whistleblowers had also prompted him to take legal action because it set a dangerous precedent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the future every new government will be able to use coached informants to do away with political opponents.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But government officials said demands that the witnesses be revealed were preposterous. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the democratic history of our country it is unprecedented that judges should be accused of deliberately setting up a case, especially when we are talking about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-corruption prosecutor who we should all support,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Stelios Koulouglou, a euro MP representing Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Syriza party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the great economic scandals, like the Panama papers have been revealed thanks to the action of [protected] public witnesses .. they are the modern heroes of our times. There has to be protection of witnesses in our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Losing your biggest client is rarely good for your share price. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that asset management firm Standard Life Aberdeen is leading the FTSE 100 fallers today. Standard Life Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are down 5% this morning, after revealing that Scottish Widows (part of Lloyds Banking Group) is withdrawing its funds from the group. Scottish Life Aberdeen currently manages \u00c2\u00a3109 billion of Scottish Widows assets -- roughly a sixth of its total assets under management (however, the deal only generates around 5% of SLA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue) SLA say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisappointed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- Lloyds has jumped at the first opportunity to pull its funds, following a six-month transition period following the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management last year. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis is a blow for Standard Life Aberdeen, but has been on the cards ever since the merger. Standard Life and Scottish Widows are long standing rivals, and the prospect of one group managing the fund range of the other was never going to sit entirely comfortably in the corridors of power in Edinburgh. Losing this book of business would strike a sour note for the Standard Life Aberdeen merger, and undermines some of the rationale for joining forces, which was built on scale. However while almost a fifth of Standard Life Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets look like they might be walking out the door, this only equates to 5% of revenues, as these investment services are relatively low margin. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting the sort of funds involved are not run by the star managers of the stable, rather they are the sort of strategies that feature in older pension contracts sold under the Scottish Widows banner. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been a great morning for Laura Ashley. The homeware and clothing group -- famous for its floral prints in the 1980s - hit shareholders with another profit warning. Earnings almost halved in the second half of 2017, as my colleague Julie Kollewe explains: Sea\u00cc\ufffdn Anglim, Laura Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director, talked of an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overall toughening of the market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with like-for-like sales declines of 4.4% in furniture and 3.9% in decorating products such as fabrics, curtains and wallpaper. Shares slumped by 18% at one stage - or by 1.1p to a princely 5p. Despite being a well-known brand, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only worth around \u00c2\u00a344m these days. The pound has now risen to its highest level against the US dollar in two weeks, at $1.4070. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada think sterling is benefitting from signs that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on power is becoming a little less fragile. A recent poll put the Conservative party four points ahead of Labour, even though May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministers has been struggling to reach agreement on Brexit among themselves (let alone with the rest of the European Union...). Adam Cole of RBC warns, though, that sterling could suffer if May is replaced by Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the most vocal Brexiteers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose popularity has been rising in recent months as he has voiced opposition to a soft exit from the EU. Cole says: We note that prediction markets now have Labour and the Conservatives neck-and-neck as likely to be the largest party after the next election. At the turn of the year, there was a 10% point gap in the implied probabilities (55/45 in favour of Labour). The probability of this government serving its full five years has also risen to a new high (36%), though the risk of an earlier election is still high. Both of these developments have probably offered some support to GBP (sterling), though we also note that arch-Eurosceptic Rees-Mogg is now priced as most likely PM after May (ahead of Corbyn) and his hard Brexit line is probably less constructive for the currency. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest profile on the member for North East Somerset.... The pound and the euro are both rallying against the US dollar today. Sterling is up half a cent at $1.4047, while the euro has gained 0.3% to $1.249. You might have expected the dollar to benefit from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in US inflation (as a rise in interest rates makes it more profitable to hold dollars). Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says other factors are in play, though: A slightly higher-than-expected US CPI print was enough to get 10-year bond yields up to 2.92%, while equity and commodity prices both rallied sharply and the Vix [volatility index] fell back under 20. The dollar, on the other hand, got absolutely no support from any of this. A reminder if we needed that the better the global economic story, the worse it is for the dollar. The biggest single factor undermining the dollar this year has been the improvement in the global economy - a more balanced economic recovery drags investment away from the US and towards more interesting markets. European stock markets are gaining ground this morning, as traders shake off their recent jitters. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained around 37 points or 0.5%, to 7250. Mining firm Anglo American and investment group Old Mutual are leading the risers, up over 3%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both involved in South Africa, so are getting a boost from president Zuma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. The French stock market has jumped 1%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is up 0.6%. But what about those inflation worries? Shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong consumer prices data from America have spooked the markets, as it paves the way for higher interest rates? Apparently not. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because separate data from Wednesday showing a drop in US retail sales has persuaded investors that central bankers will tread cautiously. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: A soft retail number simply gives the message that consumers have started to ease off from their spending or they are not digging deep into their pockets. A sensible approach would be that the Fed isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to increase the interest rate when they can clearly see that the retail data was soft. A solid day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in Asia: South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is surging this morning, after president Jacob Zuma resigned. Zuma ended a long battle with his own party by stepping down last night, before a no confidence vote. Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa is now lined up to replace Zuma, whose tenure has been dogged by allegations of corruption and economic malaise. One of Ramaphosa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first tasks is to get South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 budget delivered next week. Ramaphosa is one of South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest men, and investors are hoping that he can turn the country around. The benchmark Top40 index has jumped by almost 3% today, extending its recent gains: But... Ramaphosa faces a massive challenge, as my colleague Jason Burke explains: Cape Town, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second city, is running out of water. According to government statistics, the total number of people living with HIV increased from an estimated 4.72 million in 2002 to 7.03 million by 2016, though the rate of infection is declining. Unemployment remains at an historic high of 27.7% across the general population, and as high as 68% among young people. Economic growth has been limited in recent years, averaging little more than half the rate of population growth of 1.2%. Zuma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure has sent the rand surging and will spur a rush of much-needed foreign investment. China and South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are closed today, as traders celebrate the Lunar New Year. Trading volumes have been lighter across Asia, which may be aiding the sense of calm in the markets. But Rob Carnell, chief Asia economist at ING, sounds most unconvinced that this tranquility will last...... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having just gone through the roller coaster of equity sell-off induced by bond yield rises, I am frankly at a loss to explain what is now happening. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can only assume that we are in a temporary lull before the turmoil returns. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil, investors seem to have rediscovered their appetite for risk. Asia-Pacific stock markets are rallying across the board, with Japan and Australia both up around 1%. Associated Press have the details: Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 1.5% to 21,464.98 and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 climbed 1.2% to 5,909.00. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng advanced 2% to close at 31,115.43 in a half-day trading session. Indexes in Southeast Asia, New Zealand and India also rose. European markets are also expected to rise, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, as the City looks to put recent volatility behind it. The markets have also shaken off Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly strong inflation data. As we covered yesterday, shares were briefly hit after US consumer prices jumped by 0.5% last month, but in the end the Dow Jones finished the day up 1%. Higher inflation raises the pressure on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers, particularly those at the Federal Reserve, to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates. That would be bad for bond prices, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably a mistake to assume the markets have calmed down now. As Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Whilst the market is showing signs of carving out a bottom and the volatility index (VIX) or fear gauge, has dropped back below 20, after peaking at over 50 just last week, it is unlikely that this is the last we have seen of the volatility as markets claw back these recent losses. Today, investors will be looking at the latest American weekly unemployment figures, and new data showing how US factories fared last month, and how their prices changed. Plus, several European Central Bank policymakers are giving speeches today, which might move the markets. The agenda: 8.15am GMT: ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Yves Mersch speaks in Paris 10.45am GMT: ECB Peter Praet speaks at the French finance ministry 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 1.30pm GMT: US producer prices data for January 2.15pm GMT: US industrial production for January",

Over the three months covering the Christmas and New Year period (November to January), the volume of retail sales was just 0.1 percent up on the previous three months - the weakest growth we have seen on this measure for nearly a year. While inflation continues to run ahead of pay increases, it is not surprising that consumers are cautious and retail sales growth is sluggish.</p> <p>Looking ahead, we should expect the squeeze on consumer spending from high inflation to ease as we progress through this year. But the economic benefits of lower inflation are unlikely to be felt until the second half of 2018 at the earliest. The first half of this year will continue to be a difficult environment for retailers and other consumer-facing sectors.</p> <p>The silver lining to these consumer spending clouds is that the global economy is still performing strongly, as we saw from very positive figures for growth in our EU partners released yesterday. So disappointing performance in retailing and other consumer sectors is being offset by a positive uplift from strong growth elsewhere in Europe and across the global economy. UK economic growth should be around 1.5 percent this year - disappointing in comparison with other major economies, but strong enough to prevent a significant rise in unemployment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a86b3cfe4b08a7971395a13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-16T10:35:36.102Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And the UK research director at Global Data Retail:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pat_gdretail/status/964437233490018306\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ONS retail sales data much worse than expected, though why anyone thought people had suddenly gone on a January shopping spree is a mystery to me. <a href=\"https://t.co/pyDZwr7ZXC\">https://t.co/pyDZwr7ZXC</a></p>&mdash; Patrick O&#39;Brien (@pat_gdretail) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pat_gdretail/status/964437233490018306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a86b33fe4b0c73a42841850\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-16T10:33:16.541Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samueltombs/status/964437854750498816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Falling food sales to blame for  January&#39;s below-consensus UK retail sales.

But he believes the Bank of England could still raise rates in May :</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After what was a particularly tough Christmas trading period for retailers, consumers continued to keep the foot on the brakes through January. Retail sales barely increased in the first month of the year (0.1% rise), suggesting that shoppers were reluctant to heavily participate in the traditional January sales, backing-up separate findings from Visa. For now, we see few catalysts for a sustained rebound in spending over coming months.</p> <p>Consumer confidence remains depressed (despite some recent improvement) and disposable incomes look set to remain under pressure. True, wage growth has been performing better recently, giving the Bank of England increased confidence that the tight labour market is prompting firms to offer more generous pay packets. That said, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days and we think there remains a risk that some firms take a more cautious stance, amidst slower economic momentum and elevated uncertainty. At the same time, food and fuel costs are continuing to rise, even though in general consumer prices have largely adjusted to the post-Brexit weakening in the pound.</p> <p>When it comes to the outlook for interest rates though, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that the Bank of England has already factored much of this weakness into their assessment of UK growth. Assuming the next couple of wage growth readings continue to paint an improved picture, we think policymakers will have enough confidence to hike rates in May - although of course, this remains heavily contingent on progress in the Brexit negotiations.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2af4d9339408156ad742a63ae2e846a4d3c7c322\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2af4d9339408156ad742a63ae2e846a4d3c7c322/0_0_1063_834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"retsales1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"785\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hopes for a rebound on December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor UK retail sales results failed to materialise after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data revealed sluggish growth in January.</p> <p>UK shoppers continued the theme of keeping their money in their pockets post-Christmas, and weaker than expected data could now have an adverse effect on the pound, which has been heading for its best weekly performance since September.</p> <p>Positive Brexit negotiations and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglass half-full mentality\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surrounding talks could start to rub off on the market and consumers might take heart from this, but the market is currently volatile and retail sales growth could be unpredictable for the next few months.</p> <p>The bigger picture still shows that consumer price inflation sits at 3% and wage growth is continuing to languish, so before we see any movement on both fronts, there could be a glass ceiling in place for any retail sales growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be a retailer right now?

CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hewson again:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK had a pretty rotten month in December, with a slump of 1.5%, though that was largely as a result of bumper November number of 1.1% which had been boosted by Black Friday sales spending.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Recent retail sales numbers from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG earlier this month appeared to show that while some retailers were struggling we did see a pickup in January, as consumers started to re-open their wallets after a slow December.

Investors will now turn their attention towards UK retail sales due this morning at 09:30 GMT. Analysts are expecting retail sales to have increased 2.4% year on year in January, up from 1.3% in December.

                "bodyText":"Despite hopes of a pick-up in high street spending after a poor December, UK retail sales came in weaker than expected in January. Sales of gym wear improved but food sales fell, according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile the boss of the British Chambers of Commerce has warned that UK companies face a recruitment crisis. In the US, housing starts were higher than expected in January, as were import prices, a further sign of growing inflationary pressures. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. After five days of rises, US markets have edged higher at the start of the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final trading day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 35 points or 0.14% while the S&amp;P 500 is 0.03% better and the Nasdaq Composite 0.04% higher. The US housing and import price data and some mixed company results - Kraft Heinz missed expectations, Coca-Cola bettered them - has push the futures into the red. Reversing earlier gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now expected to open around 13 points lower. Meanwhile US import prices climbed by more than expected in January, adding to the signs of increasing inflationary pressures. With increases in the cost of imported petrol and other goods, import prices climbed by 1% last month, compared to a 0.1% rise in December and expectations of a 0.6% increase. More signs of strength in the US housing market. Housing starts in January came in at 1.326m units, up from a revised December figure of 1.209m and higher than the expected 1.234. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was initially given as 1.192m units. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for the US markets: US markets are expected to open higher again, with the futures suggesting a 74 point initial rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: US equity markets could end the week with a full house of gains as long as indices manage to hold onto the small gains being seen in futures ahead of the open. This would also bring an end to two shocking weeks for equity markets that saw more than 10% quickly wiped off indices, the first time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen such a move since the start of 2016. While the prospect of higher yields and interest rates, combined with a surge in volatility, have been blamed for the decline, the rebound we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now seeing reaffirms the belief that fundamentals are still strong which should prevent the situation deteriorating further. The head of the British Chambers of Commerce has warned companies are facing a recruitment crisis and urged the government to act, in an article for the Guardian: British companies are facing a recruitment crisis, with labour shortages hitting critical levels in some sectors, according to a business leader who has urged the government to produce details on a post-Brexit immigration system. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the lack of candidates for some jobs was biting hard, and he warned ministers against bringing forward a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153draconian and damaging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd visa or work permit system. Surveys by the BCC showed that nearly three-quarters of firms trying to recruit had been experiencing difficulties \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at or near the highest levels since [BCC] records began over 25 years ago\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he said. Here is our full report: And here is Marshall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinion piece: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the UK retail sales. Sarah Butler writes: January was a tough month for high street retailers as sales rose just 0.1%, far below City expectations, as higher prices continued to deter shoppers from spending. City analysts had expected a recovery of around 0.5% last month, after the unexpectedly sharp fall of 1.4% in December. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) indicate a pick up in year-on-year growth to 1.6% in January, from 1.5% in December, but analysts had hoped for a bigger turnaround after a very disappointing end to last year. Food sales fell again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 0.9% in volume terms on December \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that was offset by a rise in sales of gym kit and children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toys. Rhian Murphy, ONS senior statistician, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail sales growth was broadly flat at the beginning of the new year with the longer-term picture showing a continued slowdown in the sector. This can partly be attributed to a background of generally rising prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said there had been a 0.9% decline in the volume of food compared with January 2017 while non-food rose 2.6%, led by sports equipment, games and toys. An uplift in sales of gym kit as consumers resolved to get fit and lose weight contributed to a year-on-year rise. It was the sixth consecutive month of decline in the volume of food sold. Read more here: Sterling has slipped into negative territory against the dollar, as investors mull over the weaker than expected retail sales. The pound is down 0.18% at $1.4070 having earlier been as high as $1.4144. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.06% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1264. Commenting on the retail sales figures, Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, said: The squeeze on consumer spending created by high inflation and a weakened pound continues. Over the three months covering the Christmas and New Year period (November to January), the volume of retail sales was just 0.1 percent up on the previous three months - the weakest growth we have seen on this measure for nearly a year. While inflation continues to run ahead of pay increases, it is not surprising that consumers are cautious and retail sales growth is sluggish. Looking ahead, we should expect the squeeze on consumer spending from high inflation to ease as we progress through this year. But the economic benefits of lower inflation are unlikely to be felt until the second half of 2018 at the earliest. The first half of this year will continue to be a difficult environment for retailers and other consumer-facing sectors. The silver lining to these consumer spending clouds is that the global economy is still performing strongly, as we saw from very positive figures for growth in our EU partners released yesterday. So disappointing performance in retailing and other consumer sectors is being offset by a positive uplift from strong growth elsewhere in Europe and across the global economy. UK economic growth should be around 1.5 percent this year - disappointing in comparison with other major economies, but strong enough to prevent a significant rise in unemployment. And the UK research director at Global Data Retail: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakdown of non-food sales, showing the growth in sports equipment: Following the disappointing retail sales, economist James Smith at ING Bank is not optimistic about the outlook for the sector. But he believes the Bank of England could still raise rates in May : After what was a particularly tough Christmas trading period for retailers, consumers continued to keep the foot on the brakes through January. Retail sales barely increased in the first month of the year (0.1% rise), suggesting that shoppers were reluctant to heavily participate in the traditional January sales, backing-up separate findings from Visa. For now, we see few catalysts for a sustained rebound in spending over coming months. Consumer confidence remains depressed (despite some recent improvement) and disposable incomes look set to remain under pressure. True, wage growth has been performing better recently, giving the Bank of England increased confidence that the tight labour market is prompting firms to offer more generous pay packets. That said, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days and we think there remains a risk that some firms take a more cautious stance, amidst slower economic momentum and elevated uncertainty. At the same time, food and fuel costs are continuing to rise, even though in general consumer prices have largely adjusted to the post-Brexit weakening in the pound. When it comes to the outlook for interest rates though, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that the Bank of England has already factored much of this weakness into their assessment of UK growth. Assuming the next couple of wage growth readings continue to paint an improved picture, we think policymakers will have enough confidence to hike rates in May - although of course, this remains heavily contingent on progress in the Brexit negotiations. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Hopes for a rebound on December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor UK retail sales results failed to materialise after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data revealed sluggish growth in January. UK shoppers continued the theme of keeping their money in their pockets post-Christmas, and weaker than expected data could now have an adverse effect on the pound, which has been heading for its best weekly performance since September. Positive Brexit negotiations and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglass half-full mentality\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surrounding talks could start to rub off on the market and consumers might take heart from this, but the market is currently volatile and retail sales growth could be unpredictable for the next few months. The bigger picture still shows that consumer price inflation sits at 3% and wage growth is continuing to languish, so before we see any movement on both fronts, there could be a glass ceiling in place for any retail sales growth. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, comments: Who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be a retailer right now? The ONS sees the longer-term picture for the retail sector as in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued slowdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the average British consumer is looking at real wage declines, higher borrowing costs, and record levels of consumer deb. The average Brit has spent the past few years living the mantra \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales number shows that UK consumer spending is not as hardy as it once was and this represents a real risk to Q1 GDP already. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Societe Generale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kit Juckes: The weaker than expected retail sales numbers have taken the shine off sterling. The pound is now up just 0.1% against the dollar at $1.4108, having earlier climbed as high as $1.4144. Rhian Murphy, Office for National Statistics Senior Statistician said: Retail sales growth was broadly flat at the beginning of the New Year with the longer-term picture showing a continued slowdown in the sector. This can partly be attributed to a background of generally rising prices. Growth in the quantity of sporting equipment, games and toys being bought was offset by falling food sales when compared with the same month a year earlier. Sporting equipment sales have grown more than usual in January 2018, following an increased uptake for gym wear. It seems the retail figures were boosted by people deciding to get fit after possibly overindulging at Christmas. The ONS said: The main contribution to the year-on-year growth came from non-food stores, with sports equipment, games and toys increasing sales in the quantity bought in this sector by 10.9%. Feedback from retailers suggested that New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolutions to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get fit and lose weight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd contributed to this increase of sales when compared with the previous year. As for food sales: The year-on-year growth rate for quantity bought in food stores showed a decline for the sixth consecutive month at negative 0.9%, due largely to a continued rise in food store prices. High street sales has dropped sharply in December as shoppers brought forward sales into November to take advantage of discounts including the Black Friday sales. Taking the three months from November to January, sales edged up just 0.1% after climbing 0.5% in the three months to December. British shoppers kept their money in their pockets in January, with retail sales coming in sharply lower than forecast. Overall retail sales volumes rose 0.1% month on month, compared to expectations of an increase of around 0.5%. Year on year growth was 1.6%, the highest since August but at the bottom end of expectations of around 2.4%. Bigger than usual spending on gym wear was offset by a fall in food sales, said the Office for National Statistics. The pound is heading for its best weekly performance since September, buoyed by a weaker dollar, the expectation of rising interest rates from a more hawkish Bank of England, and hopes that Brexit talks will progress. Of course, that is before the UK retail sales figures, which could have an influence one way or the other. Ahead of the UK retail sales figures, here is economist Rupert Seggins: After four weeks of falls - including a 4.7% decline last week - the FTSE 100 is on track for a positive five days of trading. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite a week that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been chock full of hawkish data, the markets continued to mount a comeback this Friday, extending the gains made on Thursday hit it a slew of 7 day-plus highs. The FTSE rose a further half a percent after the bell, allowing the index to tickle 7275. That is the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best price in around 10 days, with the FTSE finding a way to co-exist with cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own climb. Against the dollar sterling jumped 0.3%, lifting the pound towards $1.413 for the first time since last Monday. The currency has had less success against the euro, with its current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.127 levels at the bottom end of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent range. Sterling is presumably feeling chipper not just because of the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sustained, hawk-ignoring weakness, but the fact the UK should a solid retail sales reading this Friday. Analysts are expecting January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure to come in at 0.5%, a colossal improvement on December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing -1.5%. Elsewhere the Eurozone was just as perky as the UK this morning. The DAX rose 0.4%, leaving it a handful of points from 12400, while the CAC was up half a percent, sitting just the wrong side of 5250. The region has nothing to deal with this Friday, so any movement will be dictated by the wider macro-sentiment. Markets are holding on to their gains ahead of the UK retail sales figures. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, said: Where Wall Street goes, other markets follow, and this bounce back from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows is no different. Traders are quickly getting used to higher bond yields, higher inflation and another round of hikes in global interest rates that will follow, so much so that US stocks are recovering twice as fast as in London. Markets will remain volatile, for sure, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just found out that big investors can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay out of this market for long, and demand for equities typically picks up in the weeks before tax year-end. With Wall Street and Asian markets continuing their recovery after the early February slump, European share prices are off to a good start in early trading. The FTSE 100 is 44 points or 0.6% better , while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.49% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.55%. Balfour Beatty is trying to shake off the cloud of Carillion, the collapsed UK contractor, and today it has announced a joint venture contract win in the US. It has been awarded a $1.95bn (\u00c2\u00a31.4bn) deal to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAutomated People Mover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at Los Angeles International Airport. Balfour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share amounts to around \u00c2\u00a3420m. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said: Good news for Balfour Beatty with a major contract award that should help the stock shrug off the cloud of the Carillion mess that has left the shares down more than 10% in the last month... Despite some setbacks in the share price following the collapse of Carillion, this is yet another sign of the solid progress being made under Leo Quinn and the Build to Last strategy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first major public-private partnership contract win in the US civil infrastructure market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one that could grow significantly in the coming years, particularly if we consider the shape of proposed infrastructure plans. The hope is that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure spending plan will produce more such contracts for Balfour. Existing heavy US exposure means it is well placed to benefit, although it remains unclear exactly what the spending plan will eventually look like. [Its] shares have taken a bit of a whipping since Carillion went under... as investors have bolted for cover from the sector. But aside from the around \u00c2\u00a340m one-off hit from its joint venture with Carillion, you have to ask what else are investors assuming? There are lots of encouraging signs for Balfour that should probably override such fears. US exposure is key in tapping growth and in insulating from UK market and this latest contract is a positive sign. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets continue to recover some of the ground lost during the early February rout, despite further signs yesterday of rising inflation, one of the key factors behind the slump. The concerns about price increases led to a jump in bond yields, and there seems little sign of that ending. So, as Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, put it: The fact that stock markets appear to have recovered their equilibrium when rates are now higher than when markets first sold off, does make you question why the sell-off happened in the first place. With Wall Street up 306 points or 1.2% and the Nikkei 225 climbing 1% overnight, European markets are expected to continue the trend: The UK market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positivity comes despite a rise in the pound, which usually puts the dampeners on the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overseas earners. Sterling - which is benefiting from the weaker dollar as well as renewed optimism about the outcome of the Brexit talks - is currently up 0.27% to $1.4135 and could go higher if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK retail sales figures live up to expectations. The month on month figure for January is expected to rise to 0.6% after December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.5% decline. The year on year number is forecast to rise from 1.3% to 2.4%. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hewson again: The UK had a pretty rotten month in December, with a slump of 1.5%, though that was largely as a result of bumper November number of 1.1% which had been boosted by Black Friday sales spending. Recent retail sales numbers from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG earlier this month appeared to show that while some retailers were struggling we did see a pickup in January, as consumers started to re-open their wallets after a slow December. The recent cold weather in January may well have also prompted an increase in demand for coats and gloves, with an expectation that we could see a rise of 0.6%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: The pound wasted little time capitalising on the weaker dollar and continued to charge higher passing $1.41 overnight. Investors will now turn their attention towards UK retail sales due this morning at 09:30 GMT. Analysts are expecting retail sales to have increased 2.4% year on year in January, up from 1.3% in December. Given the hawkish tone from the Bank of England earlier this month, in addition to the higher than forecast CPI data, a higher reading in retail sales could see the pound target its previous high of $1.4375. The agenda: 9.30 GMT: UK retail sales 13.00 GMT: US housing starts We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be following all the developments during the day.",

                "bodyText":"After a fairly uneventful morning, European markets took another turn lower as investors turned cautious once more. With no guidance from Wall Street, closed for the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day holiday, shares went into reverse as the day progressed. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It was hard to ascertain exactly what caused Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late reversal. For the FTSE a copper-led decline in its mining stocks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which have a busy week of reporting ahead of them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c certainly contributed, as did Reckitt Benckiser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-full year results 5.5% decline. The lack of news from the US likely didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help, with investors seemingly craving reassurances that the Dow Jones is willing to continue last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery before following suit. Regardless, the fact that the markets have turned negative on a day almost completely devoid of anything interesting news-wise perhaps gives an indication where sentiment currently lies. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The worry is that the US will follow this pattern when it reopens tomorrow, which would accord with the historical norm; another test of the lows, and a possible new low, before the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcball held underwater\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 springs higher once again, catching everyone off guard. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 47.04 points or 0.64% at 7247.66 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.53% to 12,385.6 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.48% at 5256.18 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1% to 22,568.92 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.26% at 9806.2 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.38% to 846.07 On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. With Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Luis de Guindos set to become vice president of the European Central Bank, there is a suggestion this could clear the way for Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jens Weidmann to take over as the head of the ECB. Reuters reports: Euro zone finance ministers on Monday chose Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos to succeed European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio in May, a move likely to boost the chances of a German becoming head of the ECB next year. The choice of a Southern European for vice president increases the likelihood that a northerner such as German Bundesbank governor Jens Weidmann could be elected to replace Mario Draghi as head of the ECB in 2019. This could influence the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Eurogroup (of euro zone finance ministers) today gave its support to the candidacy of Luis de Guindos for the position of Vice President of the European Central Bank (ECB),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd an EU statement said after a brief discussion among finance ministers. De Guindos said he would resign as Economy Minister within days after being chosen as ECB Vice-President. Initially faced with two candidates -- de Guindos and Irish central bank governor Philip Lane -- the ministers had their choice made simple for them by Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to withdraw Lane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Luis de Guindos is set to become vice president of the European Central Bank after the eurogroup backed his appointment. The move looked a done deal when potential rival Philip Lane, the Irish central bank governor, withdrew from the race in the interests of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consensus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here is the eurogroup statement on de Guindos: The Eurogroup today gave its support to the candidacy of Luis de Guindos for the position of Vice President of the European Central Bank (ECB). The recommendation to the European Council, composed of the heads of state and government, should be formally adopted by the Council on 20 February. On this basis, the European Council will request opinions from both the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB. It is then expected to adopt its final decision at its meeting of 22-23 March. The new Vice President will replace V\u00c3\u00adtor Const\u00c3\u00a2ncio as of 1 June 2018. He will serve a non-renewable 8-year term. Back in the UK, and a troubled meat supplier has gone into administration: More than 260 workers have lost their jobs at the meat supplier Russell Hume, which has collapsed into administration just weeks after production was suspended following a food standards scare. Administrators announced 266 redundancies on Monday from the 302 employees at the company, which has its headquarters in Derby and operates from six production sites in Liverpool, Birmingham, London, Boroughbridge in North Yorkshire, Exeter and Fife. It is expected that all the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees will eventually lose their jobs. Meat products were prevented from leaving the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories last month after Food Standards Agency (FSA) inspectors found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious non-compliance with food hygiene regulations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during a surprise visit to the Birmingham premises. Jamie Oliver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian restaurant chain and Wetherspoon were among the major restaurants and pub groups that were customers of Russell Hume. . The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise comes after the pork company Fairfax Meadow voluntarily recalled meat products earlier this month after an unannounced inspection revealed issues with use-by date labelling. Meanwhile, in September, a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation into 2 Sisters Food Group resulted in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest supplier of supermarket chicken suspending production at its West Bromwich plant for five weeks. The full story is here: More from the eurogroup: Eurozone officials appear to be dashing Greek hopes that fresh loans of up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn will be disbursed at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting, writes Helena Smith in Athens: Before heading to Brussels for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of eurozone finance ministers, Greek officials had expressed hopes that new loans amounting to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn would be greenlit for release. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest market foray and credit upgrade had strengthened hopes with the finance ministry announcing at the weekend that both provided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong proof of restoration of investor confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the country. But officials, citing the latest compliance report of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reform progress, are leaking that at least two prominent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prior actions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or reforms, have to be completed before more loans are drawn down from its final \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout programme. The measures singled out are electronic auctions of foreclosed property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c set to begin May 1st \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and privatisation of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 old international airport, a mega project currently held up by a court decision. Auditors, who begin returning to Athens tomorrow, are hoping that both will be resolved by February 26th. Oil prices have moved higher, boosted by growing signs of a strengthening global economy and amid tensions in the Middle East, in particular between Israel and Iran. But there were some negative factors for crude, with US producers increasing output even as Opec continues its measures to try and limit supply. Brent crude has risen 0.68% to $65.28 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is up 0.9% at $62.24. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s millennials are losing out dramatically in financial terms compared to previous generations, according to a new report: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s millennial generation, born since 1981, have suffered a bigger reversal in financial fortunes than their counterparts in most other developed countries except Greece, according to a study. The report by the Resolution Foundation paints a gloomy picture for all young adults across the developed world \u00e2\u20ac\u201c apart from the Nordic countries. It highlights how incomes are depressed, jobs scarce and home ownership is slumping for the millennial generation compared with the baby boomers that preceded them. But it also reveals that on many measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c apart from unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c British millennials have suffered a more significant decline than those in other countries. The full story is here: UK household finances deteriorated at fastest pace for seven months, according to the latest survey by IHS Markit, and around 60% expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates within the next six months: The pound has edged lower against the dollar and there could be further declines ahead, says Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com: The GBP/USD has rallied to its pre-Brexit levels of above 1.40 in recent weeks as the dollar sold off. However, with the recent improvement in US macro pointers, there is a good chance that the greenback could bottom out soon. If this is the case, then the cable could head lower. Brexit uncertainty is likely to offset the support the pound is receiving from a hawkish Bank of England amid improving UK data and rising inflation. The potentially weaker exchange rate will be a welcome relief for export names in particular. However, if the relentless dollar selling continues then the cable could extend its gains further and this may be an additional factor weighing on the FTSE. In the more near-term outlook, the latest UK wages data on Wednesday and the second estimate for UK GDP a day later on Thursday should cause the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and therefore the FTSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to move sharply. Sterling is currently down 0.24% at $1.4005. With US markets shut for President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day and no major economic news, there is little impetus for European shares to show much movement, and so it has proved up until now. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Given all the drama February has brought with it, you can forgive investors for choosing to take a bit of a breather this President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day. Without the US markets to provide any guidance this afternoon the European indices decided it was better to do nothing this Monday. The FTSE slipped by 0.1%, leaving it just below 7290; the DAX, meanwhile, gave up its 12500-crossing growth to sit flat around the 12460 mark, with the CAC trickling a couple of points lower. The forex markets were just as barren. Cable was broadly unchanged at $1.4025, recovering from some morning losses that briefly left it the wrong side of $1.40, while against the euro the pound nudged 0.1% higher to tease \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13. In terms of earnings, Reckitt Benckiser kicked off a very busy week in pretty inauspicious fashion, contributing to the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sluggish start. Despite a Mead Johnson-boosted 21% rise in total revenue to \u00c2\u00a311.5 billion and an 11% surge in pre-tax profit to \u00c2\u00a32.5 billion, the consumer goods firm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which counts Nurofen and Durex among its stable of products \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fell 5.5% as the day went on, with investors disappointed that full year like-for-like growth was flat. Newsflash: Another 152 workers at Carillion have been made redundant, following its collapse into liquidation last month. The Official Receiver, which took control of the outsourcing group, says this takes the total number of jobs lost to 1,141. In happier news, 942 jobs have been saved -- because Carillion contracts have been taken on by other suppliers. That takes the total number of jobs protected to 7,641. More than 10,000 Carillion workers still face uncertainty, though, as the company employed almost 20,000 in the UK. The Official Receiver says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Discussions with potential purchasers continue and I expect that the number of jobs safeguarded through the liquidation will continue to rise. I am continuing to engage with staff, elected employee representatives and unions to keep them informed as these arrangements are confirmed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The news comes as MPs release evidence from several Carillion shareholders, which show that one - Edinburgh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kiltearn - had considered suing the company. More here: The torpor in the City has been (briefly) broken by the news that European building firms boosted their output at the end of last year. Construction output across the EU rose by 0.6% month-on-month in December. Within the eurozone, it rose by a more modest 0.1%. The figures also show that, during 2017, construction output rose by a healthy 3.5% across the EU - and by 2.4% in the euro area. Another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy strengthened last year. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout is back on the agenda today. Eurozone finance ministers will discuss Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 progress when they gather for a Eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minister Euclid Tsakalotos will brief the room about the implementation of various \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 under its bailout review programme. Once they are all completed, the next tranche of the Greek bailout will be handed over. Greece got a boost on Friday night, when rating agency Fitch raised its credit rating from B- to B, with a positive outlook, saying: Fitch believes that general government debt sustainability will improve, underpinned by sustained GDP growth, reduced political risks, a record of general government primary surpluses and additional fiscal measures legislated to take effect through 2020. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout is due to end this summer. Athens hopes to then return to the financial markets. Today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bonds are trading at a yield of around 4.2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much lower than the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdanger zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of around 7%, but higher than other euro countries. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, sees a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sentiment in the stock markets today as the global rebound continues. Many investors who are selling government bonds are putting the money into shares instead, she explains: Not even the unexpected indictments from Special Counsel Robert Mueller could hold the rally back, as US markets closed higher for the sixth straight session on Friday, resulting in the best week for US equities in five years. The strength of the equity recovery has surprised some, but the weight of money coming out of bond markets is primarily finding its way into equities, which, for the moment at least, look far more attractive than other alternatives. Latvia has been rocked by the news that its top central banker has been arrested Ilmars Rimsevics was detained by his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-graft bureau on Sunday, as part of an anti-corruption clampdown. The news is also a blow to the European Central Bank as Rimsevics serves on its governing council. Bloomberg has more details: The detention followed a search by authorities of Rimsevics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office and private property, state-owned LTV reported. His lawyer, Saulvedis Varpins, said the governor considered the move against him as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly illegal. Rimsevics has served as the governor of the Bank of Latvia since 2001 Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola has urged Rimsevics to step down, telling reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Each day that Mr. Rimsevics remains in the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership significantly worsens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think that at this moment, it would be wise if Mr. Rimsevics would at least, during the course of the investigation, step down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another development, the ECB has halted all payments by one of Latvia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lenders, ABLV, this morning. US authorities accuse ABLV of money laundering and breaching sanctions against North Korea. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is being dragged back by consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser. Reckitt slightly missed City forecasts this morning; it reported like-for-like sales growth of 2% in the last quarter, vs estimates of 2.1%. Only a small miss, but enough to wipe 3% off the Nurofen-to-Cillit Bang maker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price this morning. The FTSE 100 itself is up just 4 points, or 0.06%. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major stock markets have opened higher, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX up 0.35% and the French CAC gaining 0.27%. Traders have taken their cue from the gains in Asia overnight. They also seem to be unruffled by the latest political tensions in America over Russian meddling in the presidential election. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains: Investor sentiment has gradually improved after fears of rising inflation sent most global indices into correction territory. The Cboe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Volatility Index (VIX) ended Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session below 20, suggesting that indictments from Special Counsel Robert Mueller against 13 Russian nationals for alleged interference in the 2016 elections did little to impact investor decisions. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are starting the new week in confident mood, as investors put the recent bout of volatility behind them. Shares are rallying across Asia today, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting a positive start to trading in Europe too. The markets seem to have got over their worries over American interest rate hikes, and the threat of rising inflation. Traders have concluded that shares look attractive again, following the sharp losses earlier this month. David Madden of CMC Markets says confidence is back in the markets: Stock markets around the world rebounded last week as investors took at advantage of the relatively low prices of equities. Whenever there is a severe sell-off in the stock markets, traders spend a lot of time wondering is there another leg lower coming, or is it safe to get back in the water. The move higher last week saw some indices reach their highest levels in over a week. Market confidence often attracts even more market confidence, and that is what we are seeing at the moment. The cooling of the volatility index (VIX) has been given some dealers the green light to buy back into the stock market, and while the fear factor keeps sliding, it is likely equity benchmarks will continue to push higher. So, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei is up 2%, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 has gained 0.6%, and the South Korean market is up 0.7%. (other markets are closed for the Lunar New Year). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching the restaurant industry, as a report warns that the number of insolvencies jumped by 20% last year. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been immune to these problems, and there are fears that his Barbecoa chain of steak restaurants could be in trouble if a buyer can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be found. Otherwise, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking like a quiet day - especially as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day in America.

                "bodyText":"And finally, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has closed for the day. The FTSE 100 is virtually unchanged, down o.89 of a point at 7246.77. In New York the Dow is currently in the red. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 108 points or 0.43%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story into the Treasury Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to release the official report into Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment of small businesses. Charles Randell has also told MPs that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s committed to avoiding another financial crisis. He says the impact of the crisis was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing short of disastrous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on many people, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go there again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Randell adds that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sound prudential and conduct regulation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can play a vital role in ensuring that financial firms stick to the rules, and protect consumers. A quick clarification: Charles Randell takes up the reins at the FCA on April 1, so I should have called him the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchair-elect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Now fixed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a potted history of the next head of the Financial Conduct Authority, from Pensions Age: Randell worked at Slaughter and May from 1980 to 2013, becoming a partner in 1989. He was a key adviser in the wake of the financial crisis, helping HM Treasury on the resolutions of Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley and the Icelandic banks, as well as advising on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investments into RBS and the merged Lloyds and HBOS. In addition, he advised the Portuguese Ministry of Finance on the recapitalisation of the Portuguese banking sector. The incoming chair of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Conduct Authority has admitted an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcerror of judgement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after investing in a tax avoidance vehicle. Charles Randell is appearing before the Treasury Committee right now, and revealed that he made a mistake by putting money into the Ingenious Film Partners 2 scheme. Ingenious Film Partners 2 was a film production partnership which proved popular with many celebrities and sports stars, such as David Beckham and Wayne Rooney. It used tax breaks designed to encourage films to be made in the UK. Those who put money into the scheme could claim tax relief against film production losses. Randell has admitted that he failed to sufficiently investigate the situation, when he was told by his financial advisor that HMRC had said the scheme was acceptable. He invested in the scheme between 2006 and 2011. He told the committee that it was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153error of judgement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd not to investigate these assurances. He adds: I take responsibility for the decision that I took. I was reassured to hear that this partnership had been discussed with senior policy officials at HMRC who had indicated that they approved of it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear to me now that far from taking any comfort from that, I should have seen it as a warning signal because the mere fact that an informal assurance was seen to be necessary should have been telling me that this was an investment for which there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a specific statutory framework. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a binding approval mechanism. And if HMRC did approve it in 2005, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been told repeatedly is the case, then it was always open to them to change their mind - which they obviously did do. Committee chair Nicky Morgan asks Randell if he could see that the Ingenious scheme would look, to the general public, like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rather clever tax wheeze\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to let people pay less tax. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes I can\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Randell replied. He added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I dispensed with the services of my financial advisor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after HMRC began taking action against the scheme. I conducted as best I could my own personal assessment of the situation. I contacted HMRC and asked them to give me the terms of settlement for me personally. In early 2015, he paid around \u00c2\u00a3114,000 plus interest to HMRC to settle the matter. Sir Tom Scholar, permanent secretary to the Treasury, has written to the Treasury committee saying that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment panel knew of Randell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement in Ingenious, and felt it should not prevent him chairing the FCA. But, as the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role includes protecting consumers from dodgy investments, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great start to Randell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure at the watchdog.... Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee has just published the official report into Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment of small businesses. MPs took the decision after forcing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog, the FCA, to hand the report into RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Restructuring Group over. It ends a long battle between the committee and the FCA, which had refused to release the report (which leaked last year). However, MPs concluded that it should be published, having heard evidence that RBS deliberately put companies into GRG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clutches and drove them to the wall. Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan says: The findings in the report are disgraceful. The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Committee has not taken the decision to publish lightly. Normally, reports prepared under section 166 are confidential, but there is overwhelming public interest in bringing transparency to what happened at GRG, given the earlier leak of the report, and in ensuring that everyone can see, and know that they are seeing, an authentic and verified copy of Promontory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original report. The report is online here. Shares in US retail titan Walmart are sliding, after the company missed Wall Street expectations. The company posted net income of $2.17bn, or 73 cents a share, for the last quarter compared with $3.76bn a year earlier. It also reported a slowdown in online sales growth, which will fuel concerns that Amazon is eating its market shares. Walmart are down over 8% in early trading. Asda, WalMart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK operation, reported that growth slowed over the crucial Christmas quarter. Like-for-like takings rose by 0.5% in October-December, down from 1.1% in the third quarter of 2017. Latvia continues to be gripped by the arrest of central bank chief Ilmars Rimsevics by anti-corruption officials last weekend. Rimsevics, who is accused of taking bribes, has told journalists he will not bow to pressure to resign. Associated Press has more details. Latvia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official on the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main policymaking council refused Tuesday to heed calls to resign following an investigation into suspected bribery and an Associated Press report on allegations of extortion and connections to money laundering. Ilmars Rimsevics, who was detained Saturday and released on bail two days later without charge, was defiant, dismissing the allegations against him as a smear campaign by commercial banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I made a decision not to step down because I am not guilty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-corruption agency has started a probe into suspected bribery. And the AP has reported that the chairman of local bank Norvik, Grigory Guselnikov, says Rimsevics had asked for bribes since 2015. Guselnikov and Norvik have filed an international request for arbitration to a body of the World Bank to resolve what the document claims is the request for bribes and abuse of power by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Senior Latvian Official.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guselnikov and Norvik CEO Oliver Bramwell have confirmed that official is Rimsevics. Rimsevics said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153my retreat would allow a man like Guselnikov to triumph.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is expected to open lower, when trading begins in 50 minutes. Tin hats on, folks. Analyst at Morgan Stanley think the recent stock market volatility was just an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcappetiser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In a new note to clients, Morgan Stanley warn that stocks will come under pressure again soon. They predict a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctricky handover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in April-June, when inflation may be rising just as economic indicators cool. This could be a bad environment for stocks, they warn: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when growth softens while inflation is still rising that returns suffer most. So the stock market falls a couple of weeks ago, which drove Wall Street into a correction, could just be an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Appetiser, not the main course\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from their report: Our cycle models suggest that DM [developed markets] remains in the late stages of a late-cycle environment. Rising equities, rising inflation, tightening policy,higher commodity prices and higher volatility are (in our view) a pretty normal pattern if that view is correct. Underneath all that sound and fury of the recent volatility spike, we think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still dealing with a playbook with a reasonable amount of precedent. Inflation, after all, often plays a role in a late-cycle volatility rise,as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tension between still-strong current conditions,and the effect of tightening (later). Meanwhile, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has spoken to the German chancellor Angela Merkel. Although tensions with Turkey are believed to have dominated discussions, last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group also got a mention. Greek finance ministry officials have also revealed that they expect the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next batch of bailout loans, the fourth tranche under the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final bailout programme, to be released by the end of March at the latest. Of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn total amount, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.3bn will be used to cover debt financing needs, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500m will go towards repaying government obligations to the private sector while the remaining \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.9bn will be put towards the cash buffer Athens is currently building to cover post-bailout needs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Headway is also being made on debt relief discussions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one source adding that by March 1st plans will have been drawn up and presented to the Euro Working Group (advising euro area finance ministers) by technical teams visiting Athens. Greece came away empty handed from last night gathering of euro zone finance ministers. The Eurogroup concluded that Athens still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit all the targets to receive its next aid tranche. But despite that, the meeting wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all bad. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Though Greece failed to win the approval of fresh loans at the meeting, Mario Ceneco, the eurogroup chief, was fulsome in his praise for the country. Athens, he said, had made huge strides in implementing requisite reforms. The two \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that had not been enforced \u00e2\u20ac\u201c electronic auctions of foreclosed properties, a testy issue that the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is believed to have clashed over with ECB president Mario Draghi at the meeting and privatization of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 old international airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outside the control of the government\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am confident they can be cleared soon,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ceneco was quoted as saying. As soon as that happened creditors would give the green light for a new tranche worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn to be disbursed. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici was also generous with the plaudits saying everything must be done over the course of the next six months to allow Greece to successfully exit its final bailout programme. Both officials said discussion was already underway to restructure Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 staggering debt load \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at almost 180 percent by far the highest in the euro zone. Dent relief is considered vital if Greece is to recover from its worst economic crisis in modern times. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Howard Archer on the slowdown in UK factory orders: The overall orders balance dipped to a 4-month low in February, although it remained appreciably above long-term norms. February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown in orders seemed primarily due to a moderation in foreign demand after a very strong January performance. Domestic demand has also come off the peak levels seen in late-2017 The outlook for manufacturing looks bright on the foreign demand side, but domestic conditions could prove challenging over the coming months On the domestic demand front, still squeezed consumer purchasing power and business caution over investment amid significant uncertainties largely focused on Brexit are a challenging combination for manufacturers. This is being reinforced by increased prices for big-ticket consumer durable goods and capital goods. Newsflash: UK factory order growth slowed this month, according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindustrial trends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey. The CBI found that 30% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal in the last quarter, and 20% said they were below normal. That gives a net balance of +10 in the three months to February, down from +14 in January; the weakest growth since October. The balance of export orders fell more sharply, from +19 to +10 in February -- a sign that overseas demand for UK goods weakened this month. Anna Leach, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of economic intelligence, says manufacturers are still doing pretty well. She fears, though, that uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU could hurt the sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This month saw another strong showing from UK manufacturers. Although order books weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as buoyant as they were last month, demand remains strong and output grew briskly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the Brexit negotiations reaching a critical juncture, many businesses are concerned about future barriers to trade and are looking for clarity over the future relationship with the EU. Remaining in a comprehensive customs union will help alleviate some of those fears and give firms the confidence to invest and grow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As this chart shows, UK manufacturers have enjoyed a boost since the EU referendum (partly thanks to the slump in the pound, which make exports more competitive). The UK stock market has dipped into the red, dragged down by three heavyweight members. Mining giant BHP Billiton is leading the fallers, down over 4%, despite posting its best six-monthly profit figures since 2014 and raising its dividend. Reuters reckons traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by rising costs at the company. InterContinental Hotels shares are also down, around 4%, in spite of beating City forecasts for its profits in 2017. The company announced plans for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca new upscale conversion brand in 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - and is ruling out handing shareholders any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153additional capital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while it focuses on a new strategy to boost growth. The third laggard is HSBC - still down over 3% after missing profit forecasts this morning. Over in Frankfurt, the German DAX has also dipped into negative territory after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ZEW confidence survey. Breaking: Economic confidence among German investors has fallen. The Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) reports that its monthly index of German economic expectations shrank by 2.6 points this month, to 17.8. Expectations for the eurozone, US, UK and Japanese economies also declined. Investors are also a little gloomier about current economic conditions in Germany -- this subindex fell by 2.9 this month to 92.3. Confidence may have been hit by the recent turbulence in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets, and the struggle to form a German coalition government. ZEW president Professor Achim Wambach says the German economy still looks strong, though: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest survey results continue to show a positive outlook for the German economy. The assessment of the current economic situation is still on a very high level and the economy is expected to improve in the coming six months. Economic growth in Germany is substantially driven by the very good development of both the global economy and private consumption. Inflation expectations for Germany and the Eurozone have also started to increase.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more expert reaction: Hello.... The pound is suddenly rallying, shaking off its early losses. The recovery has been triggered by a report in Business Insider, saying that the European Parliament is drawing up a plan to give Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privileged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd access to the single market. If so, that would calm some of the worries about a hard Brexit. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from the report: Exclusive: The European Parliament is preparing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153detailed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 60-paragraph resolution which will call for more flexibility in future relationship talks with Britain. The Parliament wants the EU to negotiate an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcassociation agreement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which could give Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privileged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd single market access and membership of EU agencies. The resolution marks a break from the position of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator. The Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans were revealed to British MPs during meetings in Brussels this week. More here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to William Hill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money-laundering fine, from deputy Labour leader Tom Watson: My colleague Randeep Ramesh points out that he highlighted this problem back in 2013: UK betting company William Hill has been hit with a \u00c2\u00a36.2m fine today, after accepting money linked to criminal activities. Gambling regulators imposed the penalty for failing to stick to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations. Angela Monaghan explains all: The Gambling Commission said that over the two years to August 2016, the company failed to spot obvious signs of problem gambling, and in doing so breached anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations. It is the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest penalty on record, after it fined the betting firm 888 \u00c2\u00a37.8m last year for failing to protect vulnerable customers. The regulator said that as a result of failings by senior management and staff at William Hill, 10 customers were able to deposit money linked to criminal offences, which resulted in financial gains for the group of around \u00c2\u00a31.2m. Tim Miller, executive director of the Gambling Commission, said there were clear warning signs of problem gambling in the spending patterns of some customers that William Hill should have picked up on. Over in the City, shares in banking giant HSBC have fallen by 4% in early trading. HSBC reported an 11% jump in adjusted pre-tax profits for the last year, to almost $21bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s below analyst expectations; not a great way for outgoing CEO Stuart Gulliver to sign off. Revenues grew 5%, as the bank benefits from the pick-up in global growth. Gulliver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement, John Flint, reckons he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a great platform to build on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Shareholders are less optimistic, knocking the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares down 31p to 729p. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: HSBC has definitely pinned its flag to the Asian mast, with over three quarters of profits now coming from the far east. The long term appeal of this approach is clear, with the Asian middle class set to balloon by a staggering 2 billion people by 2050. However this approach comes with risks attached. The strength of HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price over the last two years has a lot to do with better than expected economic performance from China. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all well and good, but this cuts both ways, and looking forward if China sneezes, HSBC is going to catch a nasty cold. In another sign of Brexit angst, City traders have been buying more insurance against the pound weakening. Bloomberg has spotted that protecting yourself against short-term sterling volatility is now more expensive than insuring against volatility for a whole year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually the other way round. This suggests investors expect some twists, turns and pitfalls as the two sides try to hammer out a Brexit transition deal. Neil Jones of Mizuho Bank explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit politics is expected to be more certain in the longer term than in the short term.... [but the] market is leaning toward expecting an OK outcome. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the pound is suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some pre-David Davis Brexit speech jitters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Davis delivers his speech, in Austria, at around 9.30am UK time. That means you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got time to read our profile of the man handling Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stickiest political challenge in generations: The pound is coming under some pressure this morning, as City traders fret about the state of the Brexit talks. Sterling has shed over half a cent against the US dollar, falling back below $1.40 to trade around $1.394. The pound had been rallying in recent weeks, driven by speculation that the Bank of England will hike borrowing costs. But investors haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken their eye off Brexit, and the risks of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit from the European Union. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the infighting within the government is hurting the pound. Whilst the BoE could look to raise interest rates as soon as Spring, this is being overshadowed by Brexit concerns or more specifically confusion from Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit cabinet and uncertainties over the post Brexit transition period. As a result, demand for the pound remains limited. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses come ahead of an eagerly-awaited speech from David Davis, secretary of state for leaving the EU. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pledge the Britain won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abandon workers rights and environmental concerns after Brexit. In a colourful twist, Davis is expected to promise that Britain won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn into a Mad Max-style dysopia. That sort of talk might not calm nerves in the City..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are expected to open cautiously today, after a weak session in Asia. The Japanese and South Korean markets have both shed around 1%, with some profit taking after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Although the volatility has calmed down, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still some anxiety out there, as David Madden of CMC Markets says: The herd mentality is always evident in the wake of a major sell-off as individuals like to feel they are part of the pack. The CBI will release a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector today, which might move the markets. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a fresh German economic confidence report. It may show that the recent stock market volatility, and the long coalition talks in Germany, have hit morale. On the corporate front, HSBC, BHP Billiton and Intercontinental Hotels are reporting results. The agenda: 10am GMT: The ZEW index of German economic confidence for February 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends survey for February 3pm GMT: The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurozone consumer confidence survey for February",

Stoked by the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness since the EU referendum, inflation has been stubbornly high for several months, and showed no signs of abating in January, as the consumer price index (CPI) held steady at 3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the same level seen in December 2017. Economists had forecast the rate to fall to 2.9% as the sudden fall in the value of sterling begins to fade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however rising fuel prices at a time of sustained global growth are beginning to offset the dimming influence of the exchange rate on inflation. The Bank of England, which is tasked by the government to keep inflation at 2%, said it would need to raise interest rates somewhat earlier and to a greater extent than previously thought \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which economists reckon could mean an increase in the cost of borrowing from as early as May. </p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Monthly trade deficit widens despite positive broader trend</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/22/the-brexit-economy-things-are-starting-to-deteriorate\">The Brexit economy: things are starting to deteriorate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"trade\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/25/uk-manufacturers-weak-pound-exports-cbi-sterling-brexit\">Hopes of a trade boost for the economy</a> from booming global growth and the weak pound benefiting exporters took a knock last month, as the latest figures show the gap between what Britain imports and sells abroad continued to grow. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/09/uk-trade-deficit-grows-oil-price-rise-pushes-up-cost-fuel-imports\">The total trade in goods and services deficit widened by \u00c2\u00a31.2bn to \u00c2\u00a34.9bn in December</a> over the previous month, driven wider by an increase in fuel imports from non-EU countries. Excluding services, the difference between the value of goods brought into the country and sold abroad widened to \u00c2\u00a313.6bn, making it the worst month since September 2016.

Public sector net borrowing, excluding nationalised banks, was in surplus by \u00c2\u00a310bn in January \u00e2\u20ac\u201c beating expectations for a surplus of \u00c2\u00a39.5bn. For the first 10 months of the 2017 financial year, the deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is the difference between what the government spends and what it brings in from tax receipts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has fallen by \u00c2\u00a37.2bn compared with the same period a year ago to \u00c2\u00a337.7bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lowest figure at this stage of the financial year since 2008. Should the state of the national finances remain broadly similar over the final two months of the fiscal year, borrowing should undershoot the Office for Budget Responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast for the deficit to be \u00c2\u00a349.9bn, handing the chancellor even more good news when he makes his Spring Statement on 13 March. </p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Shock unemployment jump, although signs of wages rising</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"unemployment\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"wages\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/22/you-dont-raise-rates-when-unemployment-is-rising-experts-debate-brexit-watch-data\">'You don't raise rates when unemployment is rising' \u00e2\u20ac\u201c experts debate Brexit watch data</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/21/uk-unemployment-rises-at-fastest-rate-in-almost-five-years\">number of people out of work in Britain rose at the fastest rate in almost five years</a>, ending an unbroken two-year period of falls in the jobless rate. Although still close to the lowest levels since the mid 1970s, the shock increase in the unemployment rate to 4.4% in the three months to December from 4.3% in the three months to September will be of cause for concern to policymakers. There was a rise in the number of unemployed by 46,000 to stand at 1.47 million. However, at the same time, the number of people in work also increased, with the employment rate standing at 75.2%, up from 74.6% a year earlier.

The economy will suffer as a result of the weak sales, which come as consumers curb their spending due to inflation pushing up shop prices. The fall in spending has been directly blamed on Brexit, given that the drop in the value of the pond following the EU referendum drove up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. Last month, food sales fell again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 0.9% in volume terms on December \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although that was offset by a rise in sales of gym kit and children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toys.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Housing market</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"rics\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/08/uk-housing-market-gets-off-to-subdued-start-in-2018-estate-agents-say\">Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market got off to a subdued start in 2018</a>, as the number of sales, new buyers, and properties coming onto the market all fell in January.

The survey found national house prices had edged higher, even as agreed sales slipped, with a net balance of +8% of respondents reporting a rise in prices. That was the same reading as seen in December and beat City economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for the barometer to slip to +5%.

Labelled as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty poor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by City economists, the figures suggest trade will have acted as a drag on economic growth in the last three months of 2017. Worse than forecast Key industries give weaker signals for economic growth Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant services industry grew at its slowest pace in January since the aftermath of the EU referendum, as the economy got off to a sluggish start in 2018. The Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI fell to 53.0 in January from 54.2 in December, its weakest since September 2016 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates growth. Meanwhile, Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse rattled the building industry, where the rate of growth barely pointed to expansion, and even the manufacturing sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite being a key beneficiary of the weak pound and booming global growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c showed signs of a slowdown last month. Waning demand from consumers, pinched by weak wage growth and rising prices, has been a key problem for the services sector. Brexit uncertainty has hit construction firms, while inflation has eaten into profit margins for manufacturers. Better than forecast Public finances set for best year since 2008 The exchequer is usually in the black in January, due to self-assessed tax returns, but last month was a particularly good start to the year for the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Public sector net borrowing, excluding nationalised banks, was in surplus by \u00c2\u00a310bn in January \u00e2\u20ac\u201c beating expectations for a surplus of \u00c2\u00a39.5bn. For the first 10 months of the 2017 financial year, the deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is the difference between what the government spends and what it brings in from tax receipts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has fallen by \u00c2\u00a37.2bn compared with the same period a year ago to \u00c2\u00a337.7bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lowest figure at this stage of the financial year since 2008. Should the state of the national finances remain broadly similar over the final two months of the fiscal year, borrowing should undershoot the Office for Budget Responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast for the deficit to be \u00c2\u00a349.9bn, handing the chancellor even more good news when he makes his Spring Statement on 13 March. Worse than forecast Shock unemployment jump, although signs of wages rising The number of people out of work in Britain rose at the fastest rate in almost five years, ending an unbroken two-year period of falls in the jobless rate. Although still close to the lowest levels since the mid 1970s, the shock increase in the unemployment rate to 4.4% in the three months to December from 4.3% in the three months to September will be of cause for concern to policymakers. There was a rise in the number of unemployed by 46,000 to stand at 1.47 million. However, at the same time, the number of people in work also increased, with the employment rate standing at 75.2%, up from 74.6% a year earlier. There was also more positive news for workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay, with figures from the Office for National Statistics showing average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.5% in the three months to December \u00e2\u20ac\u201c beating City forecasts for growth to rise slightly to 2.4% from a reading of 2.3% for the three months to November. Worse than forecast Retail sales stage weak rebound from torrid Christmas January was a tough month for high street retailers as sales rose just 0.1%, far below City expectations for a stronger rebound after a torrid Christmas. Economists had forecast a recovery of around 0.5% last month, after the unexpectedly sharp fall of 1.4% in December. The economy will suffer as a result of the weak sales, which come as consumers curb their spending due to inflation pushing up shop prices. The fall in spending has been directly blamed on Brexit, given that the drop in the value of the pond following the EU referendum drove up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. Last month, food sales fell again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 0.9% in volume terms on December \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although that was offset by a rise in sales of gym kit and children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toys. Better than forecast Housing market Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market got off to a subdued start in 2018, as the number of sales, new buyers, and properties coming onto the market all fell in January. However, the latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) showed that house prices resumed a modest growth trajectory. The survey found national house prices had edged higher, even as agreed sales slipped, with a net balance of +8% of respondents reporting a rise in prices. That was the same reading as seen in December and beat City economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for the barometer to slip to +5%. House prices rose the most in the north west of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, although fell in London, the south-east and the north-east. And another thing we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned this month \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the global economy is showing signs of overheating There are signs from the US, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest single trading partner, of the economy starting to overheat, which could be troubling for ministers as the UK prepares to rely more on US trade after Brexit. Figures from the US job market showed wages rising at the fastest annual rate since 2009, as the American economy created 200,000 new jobs last month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a better performance than had been expected by economists. However, what might on the face of it look like good news was interpreted as a dangerous sign by the financial markets, triggering a massive sell-off as stocks fell at the fastest rate in more than two years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because investors fear stronger pay growth may lead to rising inflation, as companies push-up their prices to offset the impact from rising pay demands. Rising inflation could lead the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than anticipated and could also damage the economy. The UK exports in the region of \u00c2\u00a3100bn of goods and services to the US, almost a fifth of the total sold around the world.",

This factor continued to dampen consumer spending growth in the second half of 2017, but was offset by a stronger world economy, which boosted UK exports in areas like manufacturing and financial and business services.</p> <p>Government spending also provided some support as the Chancellor eased off on austerity, particularly as regards public investment. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result of these factors, UK growth picked up to around 0.4-0.5% per quarter in the second half of 2017 from only around 0.2-0.3% in the first half. But there are signs that growth may have eased off again in January, so we expect UK growth to remain relatively modest at around 1.5% in 2018 as a whole.

                "bodyText":"And finally, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market clawed back some of its losses to end the day down 29 points, or 0.4%, at 7272 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly thanks to a pick-up on Wall Street, where traders welcomed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong weekly jobless figures. City traders have also been digesting today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK growth downgrade, and its implications for monetary policy. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: UK GDP was revised downwards to 0.4% quarter on quarter, missing expectations of 0.5%. Britain grew just 1.4% year on year making it the slowest growing major economy, lagging behind Italy and Japan, as Brexit uncertainties continue to impact on data. Whilst this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a huge downwards revision, it was sufficient to knock investor confidence over whether the BoE will be able to hike rates as soon as May. The question arises once again as to whether the UK economy is strong enough to sustain a rate rise in the Spring, with so many Brexit uncertainties still unresolved. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures, by my colleague Angela Monaghan: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew at a slower rate than first thought in the final three months of 2017, leaving the UK lagging further behind other major economies as it prepares to leave the EU. The Office for National Statistics revised down its estimate for UK growth in the fourth quarter to 0.4%, following an earlier estimate of 0.5% and missing economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts that the rate would be unchanged. It said UK production was lower than initially estimated, and said consumers were less willing to spend due to the price rises triggered by the sharp fall in the pound following the Brexit vote. The weaker end to the year weighed on the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in 2017 overall, with growth revised down from 1.8% to 1.7% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the weakest in five years. As the global recovery gathers pace, Britain is falling behind other major economies. The German economy grew by 2.2% in 2017, French GDP increased by 1.9%, and the US economy expanded by 2.3%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A number of very small revisions to mining, energy generation and services were enough to see a slight downward revision to quarterly growth overall,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Darren Morgan, a statistician at the ONS. More here: I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdll be back later with the closing market report.... The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Brexit Dashboard is out. This month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report warns that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cracks are starting to appear in UK economic resilience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with growth revised down today and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs figures showing a rise in unemployment. Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation has tweeted about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report, explaining how the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis has been so mediocre: Newsflash from America: The number of US citizens signing on for unemployment benefit fell to 222,000 last week, down from 229,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the 45-year low set in January, and shows the US labor market is robust. Back in the financial markets, shares in mobile phone game-maker Rovio Entertainment have taken a real hammering. Shares in Rovio are down 47% after it released a shock profits warning. The firm, famous for its Angry Birds game, now expects to make between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac260m and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300m this year - analysts had expected \u00e2\u201a\u00ac336. Rovio only floated on the stock market last September, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11.50 per share; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now worth just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.20. Bloomberg pins some of the blame for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow economy on the 2016 EU referendum, and the slide in sterling: Part of the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness reflects the fallout from the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop since the vote to leave the EU in 2016. After inflation surged, household spending rose the least in five years in 2017. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool has created a neat chart, showing how economic uncertainty can hit business investment. The orange line uses newspaper articles in The Times and Financial Times discussing economic policy uncertainty, and shows its deviation from its average over the last three years. You can see how uncertainty spiked in 2016 (after the Brexit vote), just as business investment (blue) declined. Earlier in the decade, though, business investment rose steadily as economic uncertainty declined. Professor Milas explains: Efforts by Ms May to clarify Brexit issues in 2017 have contributed to a 2.1% growth in Business investment (in 2017) following from the disastrous 0.5% drop in 2016. What the graph is really telling us is that Business leaders are crying for additional clarity so that they can invest again! Just in: UK retail sales growth has slowed, for the third month in a row. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck on the sector, which found that sales fell across clothing, footwear &amp; leather, department stores, and furniture &amp; carpets. The CBI found that 32% of respondents reported that sales volumes were up on a year ago in February, while 24% said they were down. That giving a balance of +8%, down from +12 in January. On a year-on-year basis, the UK economy grew by 1.4% in the last quarter of 2017. In contrast, the eurozone grew by 2.7%, Germany expanded by 2.9%, France grew by 2.4%, and American GDP rose by 2.5%. Italy grew by a more modest 1.6%. Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital UK, is disappointed that UK business investment was flat in the last quarter of 2017. We would like to see businesses taking a more proactive approach to tackling productivity and driving growth through positive investment in key assets over the next few months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, predicts that the UK will continue to lag behind major economies such as the US and Germany this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big picture has not changed. The UK economy is still estimated to have slowed markedly in the first half of 2017 as higher inflation - linked primarily to the weaker pound after the Brexit vote - dampened real household spending power. This factor continued to dampen consumer spending growth in the second half of 2017, but was offset by a stronger world economy, which boosted UK exports in areas like manufacturing and financial and business services. Government spending also provided some support as the Chancellor eased off on austerity, particularly as regards public investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result of these factors, UK growth picked up to around 0.4-0.5% per quarter in the second half of 2017 from only around 0.2-0.3% in the first half. But there are signs that growth may have eased off again in January, so we expect UK growth to remain relatively modest at around 1.5% in 2018 as a whole. This would not be disastrous by any means, but would place us towards the bottom of the G7 growth league table together with Italy and Japan, rather than at the top with Germany and the US.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth downgrade suggest the UK economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for an interest rate hike, suggests Sam Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, is concerned that the economy remains unbalanced - with the trade deficit widening in the last quarter. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The brief flurry of optimism triggered by December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakthrough in Brexit negotiations is looking ever more illusory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This downward revision to fourth quarter GDP confirms that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy ended 2017 with a whimper rather than a bang. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To make matters worse, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s becoming clear that the slowing momentum experienced at the tail end of last year has dragged into the start of 2018. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak retail sales figures, and the news that factory orders fell to a four-month low, all point towards continued weakness in the UK economy. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has just posted its weakest annual growth rate since 2012. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade in UK growth, to just 1.7% last year, also means the UK is lagging behind other advanced economies. Economist Rupert Seggins points out that Britain has historically done rather better.... City experts are disappointed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in the last quarter has been revised down to 0.4%. Andy Bruce of Reuters says the data is rather worse than expected: Simon French of Panmure Gordon suggests the UK isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting the full benefit of the strengthening global economy. Economist Ulrik Bie fears that household spending will keep being squeezed.. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is lagging: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The news comes at a crucial time for Prime Minister Theresa May, who welcomes her top ministers to Chequers for Brexit talks today. With economies on the continent and the eurozone as a whole both performing well at the moment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tough day for Brexiteers to present their argument, as Britain risks being left behind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Analysts at Danske Bank says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional growth engines are lagging: In another blow, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit widened in the last three months of last year. The ONS explains: In Quarter 4 2017, the net trade deficit widened to \u00c2\u00a312,237 million in volume terms, from \u00c2\u00a39,661 million in Quarter 3 2017. This was due in part to large increases in the price of fuels that were imported combined with decreases in the volumes of fuels exported. Total trade imports increased by 1.5% whilst total exports decreased by 0.2%, between Quarter 3 and Quarter 4 2017. Despite the widening of the trade deficit in the latest quarter, looking at 2017 as a whole the trade deficit has narrowed, from \u00c2\u00a346,912 million in 2016 to \u00c2\u00a340,404 million in 2017. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report shows that UK business investment was flat in the last three months of 2017. That could be a sign that firms are holding back until they have more clarity over Brexit (something Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned of yesterday). Household spending rose by 0.3% during Q4 2017, which means it only grew by 1.8% last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest rate of annual growth in household spending since 2012. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew slower than first thought in the final three months of 2017. Uk growth in the fourth quarter of last year has been revised down to 0.4%, from an initial estimate of 0.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the Office for National Statistics has revised downwards its estimated output of the production industries. Annual growth for 2017 as a whole has also been revised down a little, from 1.8% to 1.7%. The ONS says: Growth in the latest quarter was driven by business services and finance within the services sector, there was, though, a small downward revision to services since the preliminary estimate of GDP, but this does not impact on services quarterly growth to one decimal place. Business investment growth was flat between Quarter 3 (July to Sept) and Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2017, but when compared with the same quarter a year ago business investment grew by 2.1%. The ONS has also revised UP its estimate of growth in the third quarter of 2017, from 0.4% to 0.5%. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also revised DOWN growth in the first three months of 2017, from 0.3% to just 0.2%. Speaking of Greece.... Greek MPs have voted to investigate ten of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top politicians, including two prime ministers, over allegations they were bribed by the Swiss drug- maker Novartis for giving the company preferential treatment. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After a marathon 20-hour debate punctured by hostility and abuse, Greek MPs voted to probe all ten of those accused of accepting mammoth bribes from Novartis. Two former finance ministers, including Yiannis Stournaras, the governor of the Bank of Greece, are among the accused. Addressing the 300-seat House, Stournaras described the allegations as false and disgusting saying they amounted to character assassination. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These false allegations have severely damaged my honour and dignity both among the Greek people and abroad,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told MPS. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They undermine the integrity of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The claims, outlined by prosecutors originally tipped off by US authorities, involve bribes of as much as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50m being paid to politicians between 2006 to 2015 to promote Novartis products. The practice is believed to have cost the bankrupt Greek health system around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4bn. In a midnight speech, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras vowed that justice would be done. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will not cover up (the scandal),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told MPs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Greek people must learn who turned pain and illness into a means of enrichment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In often emotional speeches all of the politicians angrily denied the accusations saying the claims had been deliberately \u00e2\u20ac\u0153set up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led coalition. Several have launched legal suits against the anonymous witnesses behind the claims who are now under government protection. Ahead of the vote, EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, among those named, told Skai TV: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Justice will speak the moment these bastards who set up this conspiracy find themselves in the dock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More MPs voted to investigate Avramopoulos, a former health minister, than any other politician also implicated. At a time when it was hoped Greece was finally emerging from economic crisis, investors have been watching nervously. The debt-laden is hoping to return to markets once its final bailout expires in August. Highlighting fears, the main opposition New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis asked: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who will invest in a country with such a toxic political environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek government bonds are rallying this morning, despite the wider selloff, after Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raised the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating by two notches to B3. In a boost for Athens, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said that it expects Greece to return to self-sufficiency and market-based funding when its bailout ends this summer. This pushed up the price of Greek 10-year debt, sending the yield (or interest rate) down by 15 basis points to 4.3% (from 4.45%). Energy firm Centrica is cutting 4,000 jobs after posting a 17% tumble in adjusted profits. In a contrite statement to the City, Centrica boss Iain Conn admits that 2017 was a rough year. The combination of political and regulatory intervention in the UK energy market, concerns over the loss of energy customers in the UK, and the performance issue in North America have created material uncertainty around Centrica and, although we delivered on our financial targets for the year, this resulted in a very poor shareholder experience. We regret this deeply, and I am determined to restore shareholder value and confidence. Centrica, which operates British Gas, is planning to strip more costs out, in an attempt to boost profitability. And that means that 4,000 jobs will be cut by 2020. Unions are aghast at the plan. UNISON\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national energy officer Matt Lay said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Staff quite simply will be devastated. Although Centrica has already shed thousands of jobs, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nowhere near out of the woods, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much more misery to come. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153British Gas staff shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be feeling the heat today. It should be Centrica chief executive Iain Conn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153British Gas can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go on putting the squeeze on its staff and customers. If the company is to survive, it needs first class products, priced competitively to help rebuild its market share, and a genuine strategy for growth. Without this, thousands of UK jobs are at stake, in areas of the country where decent employment can be hard to find. Barclays is defying the selloff, with its shares jumping almost 6% in early trading. Barclays posted a \u00c2\u00a31.9bn net loss for 2017, dragged into the red by a charge following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms. But investors are happy that the bank has pledged to restore its dividend this year. European stock markets are a sea of red in early trading. The FTSE 100 has lost 68 points, or nearly 1%, to 7121 points. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being dragged down by mining giants, due to the rise in the US dollar (which pulls down commodity prices). The German DAX is down 0.8%, and the French CAC has lost 0.6%. Not massive losses, but a sign of jitteriness over the prospect of higher US interest rates. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, says the markets are in a volatile state. Just as it seemed traders had acclimatised to inflation, rising interest rates and higher bond yields, the fears that caused this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crash were reignited by minutes from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting. The Dow Jones fell over 470 points, or 1.9% from its mid-afternoon peak as the dollar rallied, making a one-week high against the pound. Economists have been quickly revising their forecasts for US interest rate hikes, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed minutes. Nordea Markets, for example, now expect four hikes in 2018: The prospect of higher American interest rates has sent the US dollar spiking. This has dragged the pound down to $1.388 against the dollar, from over $1.40 earlier this week. Over in Tokyo, a Federal Reserve policymaker has given another hint that US interest rates will rise steadily this year. Fed Governor Randal Quarles says: I anticipate further gradual increases in the policy rate will be appropriate to both sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent objective. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. economy appears to be performing very well and,certainly, is in the best shape that it has been in since the crisis and, by many metrics, since well before the crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish minutes have sent Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei down 1%, and wiped 1.3% off the Hong Kong Hang Seng. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are in retreat this morning, after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank dropped a clear hint that interest rates will rise steadily this year. In the minutes of its last meeting, released last night, the Federal Reserve revealed that several policymakers are more optimistic about the US economy, and have raised their growth forecasts. This suggests they are likely to hike borrowing costs four times this year - more than many in the markets had expected. As the Fed put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This send shares sliding on Wall Street, where the Dow lost its earlier gains to finish 166 points lower. Bonds have also been hurt by the prospect of tighter monetary policy, as volatility ripped through the markets again. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, explains: Volatility soared in equity and fixed income markets in the final hours of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s U.S. trading session. After dropping to 17, the Cboe Volatility Index gained 19%, ending the day above 20. The S&amp;P 500 reversed a gain of 1% to end the day 0.55% lower. Similarly, the Dow Jones gave up 470 points from peak-to-trough, while U.S. Treasury yields spiked across the curve, and 10-year yields breached 2.95% for the first time in four years. Over in Asia, most markets are in the red too, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting losses in Europe when trading begins. The falls come as the City prepares for the second estimate of UK growth in the final three months of 2017. This will give more detail about how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed during the quarter; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably confirm that growth rose to 0.5%.

Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms.</p> <p>Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost \u00c2\u00a360bn this is a horror story not a success story.</p> <p>With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find \u00c2\u00a33.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a8ffedee4b0398dfa9287c8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-23T11:47:18.234Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddividends can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake.</p> <p>But Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price reaction doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays).

Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly.</p> <p>Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a8ff1d4e4b0398dfa928707\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-23T10:54:07.064Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank.

                "bodyText":"Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a symbolic moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the \u00c2\u00a3110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is likely to continue for some time. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the former finance ministry official said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost \u00c2\u00a360bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find \u00c2\u00a33.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddividends can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price reaction doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down to 1.3% in January from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish meeting minutes. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data showed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The German economy continues to be in good shape,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (\u00c2\u00a3). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading highlighted there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still work to be done to reach the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target within the first quarter, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price, so until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s materially completed, the market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakeven point, the taxpayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deferred\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +\u00c2\u00a3752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of \u00c2\u00a3512m was a \u00c2\u00a3195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around \u00c2\u00a31bn to \u00c2\u00a32.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a \u00c2\u00a3110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around \u00c2\u00a350m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.015bn, below forecasts of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after nine years and \u00c2\u00a350bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of \u00c2\u00a3752 million versus a \u00c2\u00a37bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked \u00c2\u00a33.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of \u00c2\u00a32.2bn and an attributable profit of \u00c2\u00a375m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen any sort of follow through from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sir David Ramsden speech",

Clearly the ECB is in no rush at all to taper further. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSufficient unto the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would appear to be the message that this central banker is sending. Of course, the big event is still to come this week, as the new Fed chairman appears before US lawmakers. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovishness is a given, but Mr Powell is something more of an unknown quantity.</p> </blockquote> <p>David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mario Draghi...stated inflation in the currency bloc is still conditional on the stimulus programme.

The improvement in the situation should strengthen the belief the objective will be reached.

What I have been saying, in the presence of an improving economic situation, we need the right blend of three features. We are more confident that inflation is proceeding towards our objective, but we have to be persistent and patient. Headline inflation is still not within our objective, that will be key measure of monetary policy in coming months.</p> <p>The effects of monetary policy have been produced by several measures, one is net asset purchases, another is the stock of assets accumulated by the ECB.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A comprehensive analysis by the Eurosystem has concluded that adverse cyclical factors have played a crucial role in explaining low underlying inflation. These notably consisted of dampened economic activity and high unemployment in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis, and subsequently subdued foreign demand and low oil prices. Yet, these factors are of a temporary nature and should not affect inflation over a medium-term horizon, even though they might impact on the speed of adjustment in inflation. </p> </blockquote> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, the analysis indicates that the relationship between growth and inflation remains largely intact, even if it has temporarily weakened in recent years to the extent that the speed of adjustment in inflation towards our aim has been affected. </p> <p>Looking ahead, we anticipate that headline inflation will resume its gradual upward adjustment, supported by our monetary policy measures. At the same time, uncertainties continue to prevail. In particular, the recent volatility in financial markets, notably also in the exchange rate, deserves close monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.</p> <p>Therefore, while the strong momentum of the euro area economy has clearly strengthened our confidence in the inflation outlook, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy is still needed for inflation to sustainably return to levels of below, but close to, 2%. In fact, the evolution of inflation remains crucially conditional on an ample degree of monetary stimulus provided by the full set of our monetary policy measures: our net asset purchases, the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and our forward guidance on policy interest rates. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a941b42e4b05fe61cc6cddb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-26T14:36:00.414Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>ECB president Mario Draghi is due to start his testimony shortly:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/968130935467200513\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH: ECB Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speaks To EP Committee On Economic And Monetary Affairs Approx. 14:40 GMT  <a href=\"https://t.co/QnhhiKinSd\">https://t.co/QnhhiKinSd</a></p>&mdash; LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/968130935467200513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a941a23e4b04a8523004c00\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-26T14:33:50.240Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have opened higher, ahead of a key testimony by new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday.</p> <p>Hopes that Powell will keep the Fed on a steady course have helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 153 points or 0.6% in early trading.

Commenting on Draghi, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Speaking today, Mario Draghi stuck to his view that continued accommodation was necessary, and this was enough to drive the euro sharply lower against the US dollar, catching a few overeager euro bulls on the hop. Clearly the ECB is in no rush at all to taper further. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSufficient unto the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would appear to be the message that this central banker is sending. Of course, the big event is still to come this week, as the new Fed chairman appears before US lawmakers. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovishness is a given, but Mr Powell is something more of an unknown quantity. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, added: Mario Draghi...stated inflation in the currency bloc is still conditional on the stimulus programme. Mr Draghi has a track record of leaving the door open to additional monetary easing, and it sounds like he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed his ways. A final string of questions, including: Is monetary policy the only main tool for the recovery? Draghi: No, you must be tired of hearing this, I have been saying it for five years, structural reforms are of key importance. How can we avoid currency wars? Draghi: there is no currency war, the worries of the governing council are about increasing volatility which might cause an unwanted tightening of financial conditions in the eurozone. Question about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation not being on target. Draghi says the longer and more dramatic the recessession, the slower the rate of inflation getting towards its target. The improvement in the situation should strengthen the belief the objective will be reached. But the ECB target is not individual country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation target but the eurozone as a whole. And the session concludes. Question on non performing loans at banks. Draghi says the case for tackling NPLs in a determined way is clear. Banks with high stock of NPLs have given less credit to the economy, high NPLs mean less support to firms and households, harming growth. Question: will QE need to be pursued further than 2018 if targets not met. Draghi says the possible extension of QE has not been discussed by the governing council. What I have been saying, in the presence of an improving economic situation, we need the right blend of three features. We are more confident that inflation is proceeding towards our objective, but we have to be persistent and patient. Headline inflation is still not within our objective, that will be key measure of monetary policy in coming months. The effects of monetary policy have been produced by several measures, one is net asset purchases, another is the stock of assets accumulated by the ECB. The governing council will keep on reinvesting bonds that come to maturity for a length of time after end of QE. Guidance on interest rates is very important, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well past\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd comment is very important. Question about Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial membership of G30 group and what he will say to ombudsman. Draghi says we have taken note of ombudsman letter and will provide an answer by the allotted time, in April. Question on failure of Latvian bank. Draghi says he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on details of emergency liquidity assistance to the bank, shortly before it failed. Another question on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. Draghis says, almost all agreed prior actions have been implemented, just two left, expected to be completed in next two weeks. Question on Greece, and whether a fourth programme will be needed. Draghi says, lot has been done at Greece, but certain prior actions need to be taken place in the next two weeks. At the ECB we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discuss further programmes. Supplementary question on a bubble in asset prices causing the financial crisis. Draghi says expansive monetary policy is one way of explaining the financial crisis. Another is the dismantling of existing financial legislation. Expansionary policy is required by our mandate so the last thing we want to see is the dismantling of existing legislation. Question on including house prices or all asset prices in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation measurements. Draghi says our primarily objective is to hit the inflation target, our focus on consumer prices can best preserve the purchasing power of the people in the euro area. We assess asset prices, for example on wealth effects and financial conditions. Question on the appointments to the ECB board, and the fact there are no women on the board. Draghi reads out the articles of the treaty about appointments. Then he adds, diversity and gender diversity is one of strategic priorities, we are aiming to do more than we have achieved so far. Question on the US tax reforms. Draghi says US tax reforms will support the US and US corporates, but it is too early to say if the spillovers will be significant for the euro area. It will reshape the tax landscape in the world. The implications are complex. We have seen money outflows from European corporates to US corporates. For the time being we are observing these flows but it is hard to say what the long term consequences are. On the financial effects of Brexit, he says the EU should finalised clearing measures ahead of Brexit: Let me also stress the crucial importance of finalising the adoption of key pieces of EU legislation... well in advance of Brexit, in order to be prepared for all possible contingencies, including a no-deal scenario. Failing to do so could leave central banks and supervisors without the appropriate tools to handle the risks.. Delayed plane flights is the explanation for the late start to the Mario Draghi session at the European parliament, explains the chair of the economic committee Roberto Gualtieri. So he will skip his opening remarks, and will also keep questions short after Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, which belatedly gets underway. Draghi concludes by repeating calls for further policy measures: Our monetary policy measures have had tangible benefits for the euro area economy. Further policy initiatives are however needed to reduce vulnerabilities, strengthen resilience in crisis situations and increase growth potential. Only ambitious policies will deliver concrete benefits for the people of Europe. Europe is growing more strongly than expected but inflation is yet to show sustained signs of moving higher, says Mario Draghi. Ahead of the ECB president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to the European Parliament, the bank has released his opening statement. He said: A comprehensive analysis by the Eurosystem has concluded that adverse cyclical factors have played a crucial role in explaining low underlying inflation. These notably consisted of dampened economic activity and high unemployment in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis, and subsequently subdued foreign demand and low oil prices. Yet, these factors are of a temporary nature and should not affect inflation over a medium-term horizon, even though they might impact on the speed of adjustment in inflation. He added: Overall, the analysis indicates that the relationship between growth and inflation remains largely intact, even if it has temporarily weakened in recent years to the extent that the speed of adjustment in inflation towards our aim has been affected. Looking ahead, we anticipate that headline inflation will resume its gradual upward adjustment, supported by our monetary policy measures. At the same time, uncertainties continue to prevail. In particular, the recent volatility in financial markets, notably also in the exchange rate, deserves close monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. Therefore, while the strong momentum of the euro area economy has clearly strengthened our confidence in the inflation outlook, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy is still needed for inflation to sustainably return to levels of below, but close to, 2%. In fact, the evolution of inflation remains crucially conditional on an ample degree of monetary stimulus provided by the full set of our monetary policy measures: our net asset purchases, the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and our forward guidance on policy interest rates. ECB president Mario Draghi is due to start his testimony shortly: US markets have opened higher, ahead of a key testimony by new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday. Hopes that Powell will keep the Fed on a steady course have helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 153 points or 0.6% in early trading. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.46% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better, helped by a rise in technology shares. As we wait for ECB president Mario Draghi, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more on US interest rates. Federal Reserve member James Bullard says he is concerned about the central bank going too far, too fast on interest rates unless the data supports it. And he adds: He also indicated he was not overly concerned about the recent stock market volatility, and he did not think it meant investors were re-thinking the prospects for growth in either the US or globally. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest on the Melrose bid for GKN, which is likely to hot up this week. Karl West reports: The hostile \u00c2\u00a37.4bn battle for control of GKN, one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest engineering groups, is expected to come to a head this week as the aerospace and auto parts manufacturer reports annual results, which could prompt a raised bid from predator Melrose. GKN is scrapping for its life after rejecting the offer from Melrose, a corporate turnaround firm that specialises in buying unloved industrial assets, improving the financial returns and selling for a huge premium. Melrose has offered 1.49 of its own shares, plus 81p for every one of GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares. The mainly share-based bid would leave GKN investors with 57% of the enlarged group. Simon Peckham, the chief executive of Melrose, is confident he can pull off a coup and break GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resistance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in the market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our shares are going up and theirs are tracking ours,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their job to explain to investors why they think they are the best management for the business. Their shareholders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t told us to go away.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Melrose is expected to raise the stakes following GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results on Tuesday. It is thought the buyout firm may have to sweeten its offer by raising GKN investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 holding to about 65% of the merged group. The full story is here: The strength of the pound in the wake of weekend comments from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dave Ramsden - it is currently up 0.5% at $1.4034 against the dollar - is not limiting the gains in the FTSE 100. The leading index is up 0.55% at 7284, near the highs of the day. Meanwhile European markets are shrugging off a stronger euro, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.39% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbing 0.55%. Forecasts of a stronger opening on Wall Street are helping. After the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a late spurt on Friday to end the day 347 points or 1.39% higher, the futures are indicating an opening gain of around 169 points. But the outlook for the euro and therefore European markets could be determined later when European Central Bank president Mario Draghi testifies before the European Parliament. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The ECB has long been preparing the markets for the end of bond buying and recent statements, minutes and comments from Draghi himself have indicated that the central bank intends to give plenty of warning of upcoming changes leading many to expect such a warning in the not too distant future. Draghi may therefore drop further hints on the timing of such a policy shift in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing which the euro will be particularly sensitive to. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another bad morning for hundreds of Carillion workers. The Official Receiver has announced that another 230 employees have been made redundant, following its collapse last month. In happier news, the Receiver has managed to save an extra 456 jobs by finding new suppliers to take on Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public and private sector contracts. Over the last month, 8,066 jobs have been saved and 1,371 jobs have been made redundant. That means that roughly half of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 19,000 workers still face uncertainty, The Receiver is hopeful that more jobs can be saved, saying: Discussions with potential purchasers continue and I expect that the number of jobs safeguarded through the liquidation will continue to rise. I am continuing to engage with staff, elected employee representatives and unions to keep them informed as these arrangements are confirmed. The French economic recovery is gathering pace, says UBS Wealth Management, which has just raised its forecasts for the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest member. UBS now expects the French economy to grow by 2.3% this year, up from 1.8% previously. In 2019, it now expects GDP to rise by 2%, up from an earlier forecast of 1.6%. A year ago, investors were fretting that far-right candidate Marine Le Pen might become France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new president. Things look brighter today, says Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Along with the rest of the Eurozone, the outlook for the French economy has improved sharply. The risks around last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential elections now seem like a distant memory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following his election and subsequent parliamentary landslide, Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to embark on his ambitious program of domestic structural reforms has led to a renewed confidence in the outlook for the economy. The current sense of optimism amongst French firms should mean that investment continues to rise, and the outlook for hiring remains positive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the markets, shares in outsourcing group Interserve have slumped by almost 10% today. Interserve provides services to the UK government across health, education and defence. It has been under tight scrutiny since the collapse of Carillion last month. According to the Sunday Telegraph, Interserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks are reluctant to back a crucial debt refinancing deal, having already suffered big losses following Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation. Interserve is hoping to persuade creditors to agree new loans lasting up to five years, to replace emergency funding that expires at the end of March. It has denies that talks with creditors have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstumbled\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The UK cabinet office has been watching Interserve closely, and denied that the company could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe next Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Financial commentator Frances Coppola tweets: Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, reckons that some certainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with the EU would help the housing market. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK Finance numbers are quite encouraging as they bear out what we have been seeing on the ground - in other words, buyers and sellers are getting on with business, albeit at more realistic prices. Certainly we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any signs of fireworks but nor do we see any major corrections in the market either. Looking forward towards the spring market, we hope for a little bit of better news on the Brexit front which would give more certainty to the market and more balance of supply and demand in this crucial period for the housing market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although mortgage approvals rose in January, the amount of money borrowed by UK businesses actually shrank last month. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from UK Finance shows that firms owed \u00c2\u00a3263.9bn to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street banks in January - 1.4% less than a year ago. As this chart shows, UK businesses have been trimming their debts over the last few months. That may be another sign that firms are cautious about committing to new projects while Brexit remains uncertain. Despite January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick-up in mortgage approvals, 2018 is likely to be a tough year for the UK housing market, says Howard Archer of EY. He predicts that the threat of interest rate rises, and weak consumer confidence, means that prices will only rise by 2% this year. If so, that might help some first-time buyers scramble onto the property ladder. Archer writes: The fundamentals for house buyers are likely to remain challenging. Consumers have faced an extended squeeze on purchasing power, and it is likely to ease only gradually as the year progresses. Additionally, housing market activity is likely to be hampered by fragile consumer confidence and limited willingness to engage in major transactions. House buyers will also likely be concerned about further interest rate hikes this year following November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of England since 2007. While the increase in interest rates was just 0.25% and mortgage rates are still at historically very low levels, there does appear to have been some impact on house buyers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 psychology. We expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates twice in 2018 (each time by 0.25%), with the next move likely in May. Economist Rupert Seggins shows how UK mortgage approvals and house price growth are both weaker than a few years ago: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show that more people remortgaged their homes last month. They may be looking to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclock in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low interest rates, before the Bank of England raises borrowing costs. Simon French of Panmure Gordon predicts that this trend will continue, especially as a May hike is looking more likely.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how UK mortgage approvals (in green) rose in January after cooling towards the end of 2017. Breaking: British mortgage approvals have risen, for the first time in four months. Some 40,117 mortgage loans were approved in January, new industry figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an increase on December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 36,085 -- which was the weakest since April 2013. However, this is still down on January 2017, when 44,259 mortgages were agreed with lenders. The pound is gaining ground this morning, after a senior Bank of England policymaker hinted that interest rates will rise soon. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden told the Sunday Times that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Relative to where I was, I see the case for rates rising somewhat sooner rather than somewhat later\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant, as Ramsden opposed last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike, meaning he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen as a dovish member of the Monetary Policy Committee. Traders have driven sterling up by 0.5% this morning, or three-quarters of a cent, to $1.4042. Some City experts believe the Bank will hike interest rates, currently 0.5%, in May. Kit Juckes, foreign exchange expert at Societe Generals, says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dave the Dove\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has helped the pound overcome \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the usual depressing Monday morning Brexit headlines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Every major European share index has risen this morning, pushing the pan-European Stoxx 600 index up by 0.6%. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The DAX was the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most robust index, surging nearly 1% to tickle 12600 for the first time since February 7th, while the CAC posted a respectable, 5350-crossing 0.7% increase. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be interesting to see whether Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony in Brussels changes the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheery sentiment. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brutal hurricane season and other natural disasters wiped more than 90% of insurance firm Hiscox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual profits. The Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London firm, which provides cover for anything from burst water pipes to hurricane damage and kidnappings, said 2017 had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic year for catastrophes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The industry as a whole footed a $140bn bill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the worst year ever for natural disasters. Hiscox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretax profits shrank to \u00c2\u00a330.8m from \u00c2\u00a3354.5m in 2016. Its London market cut premiums by 20% but is now raising them following last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria battered the Caribbean and US Gulf coast in a month. Hiscox shares fell 8% in early trading and are now down almost 5% at \u00c2\u00a313.29. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Market pricing has improved and as a consequence we have growth ambitions for every part of our business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said chief executive Bronek Masojada. Some solid corporate results are pushing the London stock market higher this morning. Associated British Foods shares are up 1.5% after it told the City that profits at its Primark fashion chain are expected to accelerate over the next six months. Business supplies company Bunzl have inched up 0.3% after reporting a 13% rise in profits for the last year. Mining companies are also helping to keep the FTSE 100 up this morning. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re rallying because the US dollar has weakened today (which pushes up commodity prices). Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: Equity markets in the UK and Europe are off to a good start, following on from a late surge in the US on Friday and a positive start to the week in Asia. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest shopping centre owner Hammerson is adding adventure games and mini golf centres to its malls, after reporting a 6.8% rise in profits to \u00c2\u00a3246m last year. The owner of the Bullring in Birmingham and Brent Cross in London is focusing on providing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experiences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to draw shoppers in, such as ice-skating in the winter and a beach in the summer. Hammerson has just signed up Escape Hunt, which offers games where players solve a crime story or mystery, at Cabot Circus in Bristol and Martineau Galleries in Birmingham. Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive David Atkins brushed aside talk of the death of the mall. He told the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Around 85% of all retail sales do still touch a physical store, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very firmly of the view that the physical store has a genuine place to play.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammerson said 98.3% of its space was occupied, a 17-year high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our portfolio is focused on the better, bigger shopping centres and we try and provide more than just retail by offering experiences for our shoppers that provide more than just the physical shops,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Atkins added. The company is letting about 40% of its space to fashion, down from 60% a few years ago. At the same, space taken up by leisure and dining has gone up by a third to 14%. A Hammerson spokeswoman explained there was less space allocated to cheaper \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fast fashion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (with the notable exception of Primark) while shops selling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153athleisure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were taking more space. The chief executive of Bank of Ireland has warned that the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union is hitting business confidence. Bank of Ireland restored its dividend this morning, for the first time in a decade, after posting an underlying profit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,078m last year. But while it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffered any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaterial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hit from Brexit, it can see that companies in Ireland are nervous. CEO Francesca McDonagh told Reuters that some firms, particularly smaller ones, are holding back from investment until they know how Brexit will pan out. McDonagh said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While uncertainty remains for our UK business, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen nothing material today with regards to asset quality, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing that gives us concern. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For our customers in Ireland, there is an element of uncertainty, particularly for smaller businesses. We do see that two out of three business customers intend to invest in their businesses in the coming years but some of them are applying a wait and see approach.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK government says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s committed to avoiding a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard border\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear how this can be achieved if Britain leaves the Single Market and the customs union. Research has shown that Ireland could be the EU member most badly affected by Brexit. Two weeks ago, taoiseach Leo Varadkar warned that achieving a frictionless Irish border was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the tricky bit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Brexit talks.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders faced a chilly commute into the City this morning, as the Beast from the East brings a blast of icy weather - freezing fingers and causing some delays on the rail network... But once they get in, investors are expected to push stocks higher. The main European indices are all rising in early trading, as confidence returns to the markets after the wobbles earlier this month. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 0.5%, or 38 points, to 7278. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say: Equity markets are likely to continue benefitting from the strong economy and thus strong earnings growth despite higher bond yields acting as a drag on P/E ratios. Yet, with corporate bond yields still low, there seems no imminent risk for corporate funding, corporate profits and the economy as a whole. Today we find out how many UK mortgages were approved in January. Economists expect a small increase compared to December, when approvals hit a four-year low. Investors will also be listening out for any guidance from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, when he appears before MEPs later today. Draghi could be quizzed on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery, and when the ECB will wind up its stimulus programme.

Economist James Knightley says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Jay Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first testimony before Congress as Fed Chair emphasises continuity from Chair Yellen with a repeat of the policy of gradual rate hikes. Ahead of his testimony there was some speculation that he could adopt a slightly more dovish stance, but the written submission doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back this up. Instead, Powell suggests the economic outlook \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remains strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while stating \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdsome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, namely fiscal policy and foreign demand.</p> <p>He also hints that inflation is likely to rise, repeating Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position that some of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shortfall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in inflation likely reflects \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also sounds fairly relaxed about the recent market volatility, saying that despite this, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153financial conditions remain accommodative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moreover, financial conditions are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weighing heavily\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the economy...</p> <p>As such, the tone of Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s written testimony suggests that the Fed position hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really changed under its new leadership with gradual hikes remaining the theme. However, his hints at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response. At the moment the Fed are projecting three rate hikes this year while financial markets are currently pricing in around 80bp of rate hikes. Given our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for 2018 and the potential for inflation to rise more quickly than many in the market anticipate (wages, dollar weakness, medical care costs, cell phone data distortions, commodity prices), we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starting with the March 21 FOMC meeting. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a956679e4b038071a9b32cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-27T14:09:01.963Z\">2.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hamrickisms/status/968487595394072576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell very consistent with what predecessor Janet Yellen might have delivered.

The problem for FOX of merely cashing in its Sky stake is not that this derails DIS-FOX (we understand that there is no exit route for DIS, or no impact on offer value, if Sky assets are sold before DIS takes charge). Instead, the issue for FOX would be that if it sold out of Sky only then to find that DIS-FOX were blocked, FOX would be left as a sub-scale collection of mainly US assets with India as the only material international exposure.</p> <p><strong>Likely DIS [Disney] response, in our view, will be to table a direct offer to Sky shareholders.</strong> DIS CEO has described Sky as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrown jewel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asset among the FOX operations he is seeking to acquire. Just as with Comcast, adding more international distribution (direct to consumer) and content production is strategic to countering Netflix, Amazon, etc. A counter-bid from DIS would avoid the regulatory complexities/delays in much the same way as the Comcast approach.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a9531c0e4b038071a9b307d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-27T10:31:40.150Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rupert Murdoch will be furious that Comcast has gatecrashed his takeover bid for Sky, according to hedge fund chief Crispin Odey.</strong></p> <p>Odey (who was once married to Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eldest child, Prudence), told Bloomberg:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is tanks on their lawn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> </blockquote> <p>Odey, I imagine, will be cock-a-hoop this morning. <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-sky-m-a-fox-odey/odey-adds-to-sky-disquiet-following-disneys-deal-with-fox-idUKKBN1EC1QZ\">He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been pushing for a higher bid for Sky, arguing that 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid was too low</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a952ddae4b08e3dd30f5874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-27T10:18:06.347Z\">10.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is climbing higher, as City traders lick their lips at the prospect of a bidding war.</strong></p> <p>After two hours of trading, Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now up 22% at \u00c2\u00a313.50, the highest since 2000 - and \u00c2\u00a31 or 8% above Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid.<br></p> <p><strong>Laith Khalaf, </strong>senior analyst at financial services group<strong> Hargreaves Lansdown</strong>, says the market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly smells the scent of some more action before this saga draws to a close\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcComcast has gazumped 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox with a better takeover offer for Sky shareholders. </p> <p>The successful conclusion of the Premiership football rights auction has moved the dial for Sky, which secured more games at a lower cost than last time around.

                "bodyText":"A late update: Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox have - finally - responded to Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer. Fox says: New York, NY, February 27, 2018 - 21st Century Fox (\u00e2\u20ac\u015321CF\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) notes the possible offer announcement made by Comcast Corporation (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) for Sky plc (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). 21CF remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky announced on 15th December 2016. We note that no firm offer has been made by Comcast at this point. A further statement will be made if appropriate. Hints from new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell that there could be four rather than three US rate rises this year have pushed up the dollar and left stock markets flagging. Despite Sky closing 20% higher at \u00c2\u00a313.31 - above the bid price from US group Comcast - the FTSE 100 ended in negative territory. European markets also ended the day marginally lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 7.13 points or 0.1% lower at 7282.45 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.29% to 12,490.73 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.01% at 5343.93 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB bucked the trend, up 0.08% at 22,724.46 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.02% at 9900.2 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.09%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Republican Claudia Tenney asks about more transparency during the blackout period around meetings. Powell says, I would have to look at what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re proposing. The blackout gives us a chance to do our thinking and come out and make an announcement, then after a day or two people can make speeches. Generally it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been seen as a good thing to step away for a period. Democrat Denny Heck asks when America will get a raise, saying 2.9% wage growth is well below historic averages. Powell says, in time wages should grow, but we really need to have more productivity. Republican Barry Loudermilk asks about what the Fed is doing on cyber security to protect its data. Powell says I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to put a high priority on it. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done a good job but we can do better. Democrat Joyce Beatty asks if the stock market is an indicator for the economy. Powell says we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage the stock market, it enters into our thinking, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the economy but it plays a factor. Democrat Ruben Kihuen asks what Fed or congress can do to combat wage inequality? Powell says our part is to try and achieve maximum employment, which we are doing. The only way for wages to go up is for productivity to go up, which needs investment. Those are things congress and the administration would be well advised to focus on. Democrat Gwen Moore asks if inflation target should be say 2.5%. Powell says we are committed with a 2% goal, equally concerned about undershoots and overshoots. Moore asks about inequality in the US and brings up the tax reforms again. What concerns does the Fed have about income inequality. Powell says there has been a stagnation of middle class median incomes. We need to have a better trained workforce. Moore asks if we will have this tremendous GDP growth after tax cuts, or will it be under 1%. Powell says the tax bill and budget agreement came after the December meeting. There will be a meaningful increment in demand over next couple of years from these things. I expect wages to increase this year. Rothfus asked why is the inflation target 2%. Powell says it gives us more room for manoeuvre, in terms of cutting interest rates if necessary. It oils the wheels of the economy and gives us more ammunition. It has become the global standard and it would not be difficult for a central bank to move from it. Back on safer ground (probably) Republican Keith Rothfus says, there are four vacancies on Fed, can it fulfill its duties under those circumstances? Powell says he would like vacancies filled, We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need all seven [Fed members] immediately but would be good to have more faces on the hall. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tricky one for Powell. Democrat David Scott says Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts help just 1%, budget cuts hit the Afro-American poor, there are changes to food stamp system. The Fed should get on our side. Trump is not on side of the American people. Powell hesitates. He says, these are very important issues, i take it to heart, but they are not issues we have authority over. Scott says he was waiting for that. He says, there is no one better suitied. When you sneeze, Wall street tumbles. I know you have a deep compassion for people. You should say, hold on Mr President, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t right. Scotts time runs out before Powell can respond again. Democrat Stephen Lynch asks about whether the Fed is concerned about the risks of exchange traded funds [in the wake of recent market volatility] Powell says, the markets were generally orderly through the volatility, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think etfs were at the heart of what went on. We are talking to other agencies, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question to be looked into. Republican Frank Lucas asks about the outlook for the economy. Powell sayd, it does feel to me the next couple of years will be quite strong, should be good years for the economy and I would think should create a good environment. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: The new Fed chairman appears to have his feet firmly under the desk. Not only has he managed to send the dollar flying higher, unseating GBPUSD and EURUSD in impressive fashion, but he has added to this by boldly stating that QE remains a tool that will firmly remain in the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s armoury. At a time when QE is coming under criticism again, his defence will be taken as a sign that the Fed has not abandoned this powerful weapon, tightening cycle or no tightening cycle. While equities wobbled as the Q&amp;A session developed, investors seem to have warmed to his tone and careful approach. This first date appears to be going well, with markets apparently content that Powell is firmly in the Bernanke/Yellen mould that they know so well, and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about to rock the boat. Democrat Michael Capuano talks about the British ruling on the gender pay gap, and says there was a call for something similar in the US but the Trump administration stopped it. He says that is horrendous and for a fair economy, you need the numbers and the information for getting towards pay equity. Is the Fed interesting in pursuing some degree of investigation of how the financial institutions it oversees pay their employees. Powell says he is not familiar with these rules, this is for Congress. We have a job and we want to stick to that. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question for the Fed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for others. Democrat Gregory Meeks asks how much of the corporate tax cuts will go to wages rather than stock buybacks or dividends? Powell says there are estimates out there but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a Fed estimate of that kind of thing. With the dollar rising and bond yields moving higher, equity markets are heading in the other direction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 78 points or 0.27%. Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about the strengthening economy etc suggest he may be thinking of more than three rate rises this year, and the foreign exchange market thinks so, with the dollar gaining ground as he speaks. US bond yields are also rising, on the expectation of further interest rate rises. Carolyn Maloney asks, what would cause you to raise rates more than three times this year? Powell says at the December meeting, the median projection was three rises. There will be another projection in three weeks at the next meeting, but since [December] we have seen an increasing strengthening of the economy, inflation is moving to target, there is growth around the globe and fiscal policy has been more accommodative. He says, We will be reviewing our projections, [for the next meeting] and I would not want to prejudge it. Maloney asks, has the outlook changed in light of the tax reforms and the budget agreement? Powell says, my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be taking into account everything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened since December. Republican Andy Barr says we have seen a wave of bonuses since tax cuts were announced, and will this increase wages? Powell says it is hard to trace through the effects of tax cuts on wages. Lower taxes should lead to higher investment, which should lead to higher productivity, which should lead to higher wages over time. Asked about risks of the unconventional monetary policy, Powell plays this down. He says the financial sector shows modest risk. There are some high asset prices, but no buildup of leverage among households. Following the testimony, the committee chair Hennsarling asks about the 2% inflation target and whether the Fed will move from it or replace the target with a range. Powell says the committee would be concerned about concerted deviation above or below the target. The market understands this. The congress meeting has begun, and a number of senators are having their say before Fed chair Jerome Powell gets to read his testimony. The Republican chair of the financial services committee Jeb Hensarling says there should be a sustainable path to a more normal policy and says the Fed should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stay in its lane.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Democrat Maxine Waters attacks the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies and says it is trying to undermine the Fed. After a few more partisan comments, Powell is up. Following its move on Sky, Comcast shares have lost around 6% in early trading. 21st Century Fox is down 1% while Disney, which is bidding for Fox, has lost 1.9%. Following Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on interest rates and the strength of the US economy, US markets are struggling for direction in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.09%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up just 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite fell by a similar amount. ING Bank however expects four rate rises this year, with the first next month. Economist James Knightley says: Jay Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first testimony before Congress as Fed Chair emphasises continuity from Chair Yellen with a repeat of the policy of gradual rate hikes. Ahead of his testimony there was some speculation that he could adopt a slightly more dovish stance, but the written submission doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back this up. Instead, Powell suggests the economic outlook \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remains strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while stating \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdsome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, namely fiscal policy and foreign demand. He also hints that inflation is likely to rise, repeating Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position that some of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shortfall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in inflation likely reflects \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also sounds fairly relaxed about the recent market volatility, saying that despite this, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153financial conditions remain accommodative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moreover, financial conditions are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weighing heavily\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the economy... As such, the tone of Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s written testimony suggests that the Fed position hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really changed under its new leadership with gradual hikes remaining the theme. However, his hints at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response. At the moment the Fed are projecting three rate hikes this year while financial markets are currently pricing in around 80bp of rate hikes. Given our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for 2018 and the potential for inflation to rise more quickly than many in the market anticipate (wages, dollar weakness, medical care costs, cell phone data distortions, commodity prices), we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starting with the March 21 FOMC meeting. Danske Bank reckons three US rate hikes are still on the cards this year: The full text of Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony is here. More detail from Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, including the expectation of further gradual interest rate rises. But he is not specific about whether that means three or four rises in the rest of the year, something which has been exercising investors: While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory. Despite the recent volatility, financial conditions remain accommodative. At the same time, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. In the Federal Open Market Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of ... our objectives. As always, the path of monetary policy will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Breaking: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest and most powerful central bank chief has declared that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook remains strong. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has told the US House Banking Committee that the Fed will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strike a balance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the risk of an overheating economy and the need to keep growth on track. Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony has been released ahead of his appearance at Congress in under 90 minutes time. Skimming it quickly, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any major shocks. Powell seem to be sticking to the same position as his predecessor, Janet Yellen; namely, that the recovery is robust, and borrowing costs should rise - in a careful fashion - to keep inflation under control. For example, Powell says: Against this backdrop of solid growth and a strong labor market, inflation has been low and stable. In fact, inflation has continued to run below the 2% that the FOMC judges to be most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate. Insisting that the economic outlook is strong, Powell adds: The robust job market should continue to support growth in household incomes and consumer spending, solid economic growth among our trading partners should lead to further gains in U.S. exports, and upbeat business sentiment and strong sales growth will likely continue to boost business investment. Moreover, fiscal policy is becoming more stimulative. In this environment, we anticipate that inflation on a 12-month basis will move up this year and stabilize around the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 percent objective over the medium term. Wages should increase at a faster pace as well. The Committee views the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but will continue to monitor inflation developments closely. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear the words \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpoor old Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 very often (not since he almost got a pie in the face in 2011, maybe). But our financial editor, Nils Pratley, has summoned up a smidgen of sympathy.... Nils writes: Poor old Rupert Murdoch. A media titan can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even break up his own empire these days without gate-crashers turning up to spoil the show. Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a322bn bid for Sky is bold, aggressive and cutely-timed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c qualities associated with Murdoch in his pomp \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and, very probably, marks the start of a shoot-out for the UK satellite broadcaster. The open question is who will to go head-to-head with Comcast. Should it be Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox, whose current \u00c2\u00a310.75-a-share cash offer for Sky has been trumped by 16% by Comcast? Or should Disney, in the process of trying to buy the bulk of Fox via a deal that includes the 39% stake in Sky, take matters in its own hands and make a direct counter-offer? Therein lies the cleverness of Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s timing. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive, has a decent chance of exploiting confusion in the opposition camps. Does Fox, given the importance of the Disney deal, have a completely free hand to raise debt and get into a bidding war for Sky? And does Disney, whatever it says about Sky being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crown jewel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, really regard the UK TV company as fundamental to its wider purchase of Fox assets in the US?. The very worst outcome for Murdoch would be to lose to Comcast in the battle for Sky and then see his Disney deal scuppered by US regulators, which is still a possibility...... More here: Shares in Comcast are down 2% in pre-market trading in New York, following its proposal to acquire Sky in an all-cash deal. Disney shares are also down, around 1%. Wall Street trading begins in 90 minutes.... Newsflash: Sky has issued a statement to the City, urging investors not to take any action following Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to pay \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share for the broadcaster. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: The Independent Committee of Sky notes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement from Comcast regarding a possible all cash offer for Sky at \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Possible Offer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The Independent Directors of Sky are mindful of their fiduciary duties and their obligations under the UK Takeover Code. Since no firm offer has been made at this point, shareholders are advised to take no action. A further announcement will be made as and when appropriate. Another hedge fund, Polygon Global Partners, has predicted a bidding war for Sky - echoing Crispin Odey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast. Polygon portfolio manager Bechara Nasr has told Reuters that Sky could eventually fetch an offer of more than \u00c2\u00a315 per share (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still hovering around \u00c2\u00a313.30). These hedgies aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impartial, of course. Odey Asset Management own 0.9% of Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares, and Polygon has also held a small stake. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not even noon yet, but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Evening Standard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic entry into the Sky takeover story: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Mark Sweney on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Comcast bid: Comcast is attempting to gatecrash Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Sky, submitting a rival offer to the UK broadcaster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders worth about \u00c2\u00a322bn. The media and telecoms company, which owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US, said its all-cash offer of \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share offered Sky shareholders a 16% premium on the offer from Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox. Fox owns 39% of Sky and submitted its bid to take full control in December 2016, but the deal has been held up by regulatory issues. Comcast has reportedly been exploring a bid for 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entertainment assets, which include Sky and the 20th Century Fox film studio, since the company agreed a $66bn (\u00c2\u00a347bn) sale to US rival Disney. The company, which has 1,300 employees in the UK in broadcasting and film and TV production including the firm behind Downton Abbey, promised that Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters would remain at Osterley in south-west London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for growth in Europe. We already have a strong presence in London through our NBC Universal international operations, and we intend to maintain Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK headquarters,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the Comcast chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Adding Sky to the Comcast family of businesses will increase our international revenues from 9% to 25% of company revenues. More here: Analysts at investment bank Jefferies have predicted that Disney could actually launch its own bid for Sky soon. That, they say, would resolve the danger that Disney complete its agreement to buy Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox -- but finds that Comcast snaffle Sky first. In a note to clients, Jefferies say that Disney is very keen to acquire Sky - so could offer shareholders a higher price than Comcast: FOX could in principle elect to accept Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer. In that event, Comcast has reserved the right to switch from a simple takeover offer (requiring 50% plus 1 share acceptance) to a Scheme of Arrangement (requiring 75% approval of all Sky shareholders, including Murdoch Family Trust as they are not setting up this Scheme). More likely is that FOX will raise its offer well above \u00c2\u00a312.50, in our view. This would give unaffiliated Sky shareholders an incentive to hold out and see if CMA approval of FOX-Sky is forthcoming. The problem for FOX of merely cashing in its Sky stake is not that this derails DIS-FOX (we understand that there is no exit route for DIS, or no impact on offer value, if Sky assets are sold before DIS takes charge). Instead, the issue for FOX would be that if it sold out of Sky only then to find that DIS-FOX were blocked, FOX would be left as a sub-scale collection of mainly US assets with India as the only material international exposure. Likely DIS [Disney] response, in our view, will be to table a direct offer to Sky shareholders. DIS CEO has described Sky as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrown jewel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asset among the FOX operations he is seeking to acquire. Just as with Comcast, adding more international distribution (direct to consumer) and content production is strategic to countering Netflix, Amazon, etc. A counter-bid from DIS would avoid the regulatory complexities/delays in much the same way as the Comcast approach. Rupert Murdoch will be furious that Comcast has gatecrashed his takeover bid for Sky, according to hedge fund chief Crispin Odey. Odey (who was once married to Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eldest child, Prudence), told Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is tanks on their lawn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Odey, I imagine, will be cock-a-hoop this morning. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been pushing for a higher bid for Sky, arguing that 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid was too low. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is climbing higher, as City traders lick their lips at the prospect of a bidding war. After two hours of trading, Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now up 22% at \u00c2\u00a313.50, the highest since 2000 - and \u00c2\u00a31 or 8% above Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, says the market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly smells the scent of some more action before this saga draws to a close\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcComcast has gazumped 21st Century Fox with a better takeover offer for Sky shareholders. The successful conclusion of the Premiership football rights auction has moved the dial for Sky, which secured more games at a lower cost than last time around. Indeed the fact that Sky shares were already trading at 30p above Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer price tells us the market was expecting an improved offer from somewhere. As it is, Comcast has thrown its hat into the ring and is now seeking to meet with the Sky directors to flesh out the deal. There may well be some reaction from 21st Century Fox. However, since the bid for Sky was launched, 21st Century Fox has agreed to sell many of its assets, including Sky, to Disney. It remains to be seen therefore what appetite Rupert Murdoch has to pursue Sky any further. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ben Martin agrees: European-based readers may not be totally au fait with Comcast, but it is undoubtedly a massive player. Valued at around $184bn (or six times more than Sky), Comcast owns the NBC TV network, the Universal Pictures film studio (owner of DreamWorks, and cable firms MSNBC and CNBC, the XFINITY telecoms service, plus several theme parks. It can trace its history back to 1963, when it began as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153single-system cable operator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Tupelo, Mississippi. It was founded by Ralph J. Roberts, the father of current chairman and CEO Brian. My colleague Mark Sweney has more info: NBC Universal division has spent more than $1bn on TV and film productions in the UK over the last three years. It owns Carnival Films, the UK production company behind Downton Abbey and The Last Kingdom; Made in Chelsea producer Monkey; and Working Title, the British film producer responsible for Four Weddings and Funeral, Baby Driver and Darkest Hour. NBC Universal also owns cable channels including Syfy and E!. Tom Watson, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, has just commented on Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid for Sky. He argues that Comcast must pledge to fund Sky News for at least 10 years (as Rupert Murdoch pledged last week). Watson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media plurality and Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high broadcasting standards are at stake in this bidding process. All bids including this new one from Comcast must be very carefully scrutinised. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comcast must demonstrate its commitment to plurality by guaranteeing a properly funded Sky News for at least a decade as a key condition of the sale.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As flagged up earlier, Comcast have already promised to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maintain Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 existing brand and culture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and its track record of excellence and impartiality. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no time-scale on that commitment, though.... In a fantastic twist, Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brian Roberts says a London taxi driver played a key role in triggering today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid: Readers are split over the merits of Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer for Sky. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction from below the line... Oh... and if Comcast could send an engineer round to Cobberthedog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patch, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be most grateful.... Neil Campling of Mirabaud Securities says it makes a lot of sense for Comcast to acquire Sky: There is the attraction of diversifying away from the U.S. because of pressures on the cable industry there. The regular annuity stream that you have from the subscription business of Sky will be of primary appeal to Comcast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strategic fit of Sky for Comcast makes sense. Comcast has grown to become the number 1 cable company in the US so the company has a strong background in Pay-TV. Also Comcast has a large international operation through content of its NBCU assets and has previously stated interest in expanding the non-US asset base. Comcast EV (enterprise value) is $247bn so this is an easily absorbed deal. He also believes that Comcast is acting now, because Sky has just retained rights to show Premier League football, and before the UK regulators give their approval to Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have hit their highest levels in almost 18 years, dating back to the end of the dot-com boom: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here are the key points from Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise $31bn offer for Sky: Possible all-cash offer of \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share, premium of 16% to the current 21 Century Fox offer Minimum acceptance condition of 50 per cent. plus one share Confident in receiving all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner Strategic opportunity to acquire a leading content and distribution business in the UK and Europe Specific intentions to maintain a strong presence in the UK for the combined business: Continued investment in creative industries in the UK Support for high broadcasting standards and news impartiality in the UK The combined business will have the resources and capabilities across content, technology and service to compete and grow in a rapidly changing market Accretive to Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free cash flow per share in year one Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says that Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed offer for Sky is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fascinating development\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on many levels. The deal would have attractions on a number of fronts, not least of which would be the removal of complexity from the current tripartite discussions between Fox, Disney and Sky. In a land where, increasingly, content is king, there would be synergies from a creative programming perspective, whilst the potential showstopper of media plurality concerns would probably not apply to the Comcast bid. Meanwhile, the combined group would have a stable of media, production and technology outlets which would position it strongly in any number of countries. Hunter also points out that Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 39% stake in Sky is an added complication: In a normal takeover situation, the potential acquirer would be extremely keen to have the support of the largest shareholder in an effort to ease the deal through. Unlikely though it seems, this could yet happen, but it is equally plausible that Fox will need to return with an improved bid, which the market was beginning to anticipate in any event. Indeed, the initial share price reaction suggests that this story has further to run, with Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price leaping above the level of the already increased Comcast offer. Whatever the outcome, Comcast has put the cat amongst the pigeons with a move which should make for compulsive viewing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction to the Comcast deal, first from journalist Robin Powell: City veteran David Buik says the ball is firmly in 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court - will Murdoch boost his own bid, or accept Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer? CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Geoff Cutmore flags up that we could get a full-blown bidding war for Sky Boom! Shares in Sky have jumped by 18% at the start of trading. They have surged to \u00c2\u00a313.10, up from \u00c2\u00a311.05 last night. That actually values Sky at more than Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new proposal (\u00c2\u00a312.50 per share), suggesting that the City believes Murdoch may have to increase his own offer (\u00c2\u00a310.75). Some quotes from Comcast are flashing up on my Reuters terminal now. Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts are saying that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong strategic benefits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in combining its assets with Sky. The company didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak to Sky until this morning, and hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had any contact with the Murdoch family since Fox announced its deal to sell assets to Disney. Roberts also says Comcast is prepared to be co-owners of Sky with either 21st Century Fox, or Disney. [That could happen, if Comcast buy the 61% of Sky which 21C Fox doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t own, and Disney completes the existing deal to buy Fox]. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are likely to surge when trading begins on the London stock market in 10 minutes. They closed at \u00c2\u00a311.05 last night - ahead of 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer (\u00c2\u00a310.75), but well short of Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer of \u00c2\u00a312.50. The news that Comcast could take control of Sky is sending shockwaves through the media sector. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Arash Massoudi agrees that it could disrupt Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid, and even scupper his grand plan to sell much of his Fox empire to Disney: City analyst Louise Cooper says the deal has been triggered by pressure from new media. She suspects Comcast will have to fight hard to get the deal over the line. Comcast says it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to run into any of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmedia plurality\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns that have dogged Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to buy Sky. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement includes a section called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supporting high broadcasting standards and news impartiality in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which states: Comcast recognises that Sky News is an invaluable part of the UK news landscape and the Company intends to maintain Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 existing brand and culture, as well as its strong track record for high-quality impartial news and adherence to broadcasting standards. While Comcast does own a substantial international operation in the UK, with more than 1,300 employees, the Company has only a minimal presence in the UK media market. Comcast therefore does not believe that this Superior Cash Proposal should create any media plurality concerns in the UK. Comcast is also pledging to use keep Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in the UK, if its takeover bid succeeds. Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for growth in Europe. We already have a strong presence in London through our NBCUniversal international operations, and we intend to maintain Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK headquarters. Adding Sky to the Comcast family of businesses will increase our international revenues from 9% to 25% of Company revenues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NEWSFLASH: Comcast, the US cable company, has launched a takeover offer for Sky, in a challenge to Rupert Murdoch. Comcast is offering to pay \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share in cash for the British broadcaster, valuing it at $31bn, or \u00c2\u00a322.1bn. This is a 16% premium to the existing takeover bid from 21st Century Fox (\u00c2\u00a310.75 per share). Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think Sky is an outstanding company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has 23m customers, leading positions in the UK, Italy and Germany, and is a consistent innovator in its use of technology to deliver its customers a great experience.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That bid has been caught up in regulatory concerns -- last month, the Competition and Markets Authority ruled that it was not in the public interest for Fox to buy the 61% of Sky it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t own, due to media plurality concerns. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an additional complication -- since bidding for Sky, Murdoch has agreed a deal to sell much of Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets to Disney. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big day. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful central banker testifies to Congress, for the first time since replacing Janet Yellen as head of the Federal Reserve. Investors around the world will be watching closely, for hints about how quickly the Fed might raise interest rates if inflation picks up. Worries about rising borrowing costs caused the markets to plunge at the start of this month; traders will be worried about a repeat. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Although yields have fallen away from their recent 4 year high, there is still a level of caution among investors over the future of the US economy and monetary policy, which is keeping the market on edge. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the most relevant event today will be new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance before Congress, in the Semi-annual Monetary Policy Report. This is his first official testimony in a highly anticipated event. However, given the backdrop of interest rate expectation sensitivity, which caused significant market disruption, Powell is unlikely to want to rock the boat. We also get new economic data from the eurozone, including the first estimate of inflation in Germany. The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer confidence figures 1pm GMT: German inflation figures 1.30pm GMT: Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to the House Banking Committee is released 3pm GMT: Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session before the House Banking Committee begins",

                "bodyText":"Time to wrap up, before wrapping up to face the snow outside.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a closing summary: Toys R Us and Maplin have entered administration on the same day, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk at two of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-known retailers. Administrator Moorfields said it was managing an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orderly wind-down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Toys R Us, which has about 3,000 staff, while PwC has been appointed to oversee the administration of Maplin, which employs 2,500 people. Labour called on the government to hold urgent talks with trade unions and the companies to ensure that jobs are safeguarded and address weakness in the retail sector. Moorfields said it still holds out hope of finding a last-minute buyer for all or part of Toys R Us, with its newer stores most likely to attract interest. Simon Thomas, a partner at Moorfields, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All stores remain open until further notice and stock will be subject to clearance and special promotions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re encouraging customers to redeem their gift cards and vouchers as soon as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said adding that customers should do so as soon as possible, before any store closures take effect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst this process is likely to affect many Toys R Us staff, whether some or all of the stores will close remains to be decided. We have informed employees about the process this morning and will continue to keep them updated on developments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story, which will be updated later. Good night, and good luck to those 5,500 employees. GW This piece may be useful for customers: Investors who loaned money to Toys R Us face significant losses. As Alan Higgins, the CIO of Cootts, points out, Toys R Us bonds were trading close to their face value until last summer - when the US parent sought bankruptcy protection. Over in the City of London, the FTSE 100 index of top shares has closed down 50 points or 0.7% at 7231. The selloff was mainly due to worries that American interest rates are going to rise sharply this year. But the problems at Toys R Us and Maplin did cast a shadow over traders. Consumer cyclical stocks fell 0.5%, while non-cyclicals fell almost 1%. Among smaller companies, Mothercare slumped 9% to a new all-time low of just 28.35p (back in 2010 they were worth over \u00c2\u00a35). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twin administrations show that retailers are suffering badly. Other casualties could follow, she fears. Firstly, the squeeze on the consumer thanks to elevated levels of inflation, combined with wage declines in real term, which is causing consumers to rein in their spending on damaging level. And secondly, this reining back in spending couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have come at a worst time in the high street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history, as consumer habits change towards online shopping, favouring the likes of Amazon for their fast delivery and wider selection and more competitive pricing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This brutal combination is hitting the high street hard. Stores are struggling at best, but if in the case of Toys R\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 US there is excessive additional burdens, then survival is questionable. It is very unlikely that these two retail giants will be the last casualties on the higher street, quite the opposite. With the online shopping revolution in full swing and tough economic conditions set to continue for the UK in the face of Brexit, there is a very good probability that more victims will fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Heads-up: That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen as usual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sign outside Toys R Us in Manchester isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as new as I thought, sorry.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chilly corner of intu Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley, near Birmingham, that captures today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim retail news. There, a Maplin and a Toys R Us store sit, side by side - with a sign in one of the windows confirming that the administrators are now in charge. Reader Shaukat Abbas kindly sent me these photos: Over in Manchester, my colleague Frances Perraudin has been speaking to Maplin customers about its fall into administration this morning (reminder, she visited Toys R Us earlier) She writes: Coming out of a small Maplin store on Manchester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oxford Road, student Jack Poulton was clear that the business has been a victim of the rise of e-commerce. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of the products that they sell, a lot of people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially younger generations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will now look online for,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only reason I came in today is its proximity to the university and because I needed something immediately, otherwise I would have gone online myself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Poulton had visited the shop, which has been on the same site for more than 30 years, to see if they stocked a specific magnifying lens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the manager knew instantly where to look. I would have no complaints about the service. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to find what they sell in Maplin on Amazon these days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fellow student Mike Ellis said it was a shame that the expertise held by staff at electrical shops like Maplin was being lost. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes you just want to be given advice, which these guys are very well trained for. Without that you are suddenly on your own.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Inside the tidy and well-ordered store this lunch time, the staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who usually outnumbered customers three-to-one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c said they could not speak to the press, but confirmed that they had heard the news about the business that morning. Aslam Malik, who works for Manchester city council, popped in on his way past, after hearing that the company was going into administration, to see if they had a cheap DVD player for his nephew. He did not find what he was looking for. He aded: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What they sell is quality stuff, but they are very expensive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can buy a printer for \u00c2\u00a320 or \u00c2\u00a330 from Tesco and Asda these days. I would usually look on ebay and at the big supermarkets for things like that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Update: I incorrectly wrote earlier that the Toys R Us branch in Manchester has hung an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen as usual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sign outside. A reader has now got in touch, to kindly explain that the sign has been there for a while (!). Apologies... Toy sellers have been hit by a triple-whammy of problems recently, which all contributed to Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predicament. The slump in the pound after the Brexit vote has driven up costs, while the growth of electronic devices, and the rise of counterfeit goods have eaten into sales. Amisha Chohan, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales in the UK toy market fell by 2.8% to \u00c2\u00a33.4bn in 2017, according to the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) and the NPD Group. This has been driven by a number of reasons; there has been a shift to screen games as opposed to physical toys. Licenses have been under-performing for a while, and there is the ever-growing concern of counterfeit toys. As with all retailers, toy shops have also been impacted by the shift to online sales. The impact of Brexit on the strength of the Sterling (particularly last year), together with inflationary pressures such as the increase in minimum wage, has also made a significant dent into their margins.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin into administration is going to ripple through the UK retail sector - and hurt companies in their supply chain. Helena Kanczula, Corporate Tax Director at accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg, explains that some suppliers will be left with unpaid bills. There is an order of priority regarding who ranks above who when a company goes into liquidation and trade creditors would be below secured creditors such as banks and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees. There may therefore be limited funds available to distribute to suppliers. Research from YouGov has shown that the UK public lost confidence in Toys R Us after its US parent limped into bankruptcy protection last autumn. Amelia Brophy, Head of Data Products UK at YouGov, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Certainly, in the UK at least, people recognised the struggles the brand was experiencing. Its Buzz score (whether you have something positive or negative about a brand) had lingered around the +2 mark prior to September 2017. Since that time, its score has plummeted to a low point of -25. The knock-on effect of this is that the public opinion deteriorated. Its Impression score, which had stood around the +16 mark, dropped as low as -1. Most damaging of all of course, it that fewer people felt that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d consider shopping with Toys R US. Its Purchase Consideration (would you consider buying something from a brand) score among the general public had declined to +9 prior to the news it has entered administration, where once it had averaged a more respectable +15. It would have been hoping that the Christmas trading period would have injected some life back into the business, but our data indicates that it struggled to attract customers in the same way it once had, with only a small rallying in Impression score and Buzz. This is despite its Ad Awareness score jumping to +17, which does compete with previous years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 levels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The British arm of Toys R US has been struggling since its US parent company filed for bankruptcy protection last September. The UK arm kept operating, in the hope of finding a buyer. That sounds laudable, but Philip Marshall QC of Serle Court argues that creditors could now lose out. The list of creditors includes the government (through its unpaid \u00c2\u00a315m VAT bill) and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pensions protection scheme (which picks up a \u00c2\u00a337m deficit). Marshall explains why some tough questions need to be asked: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the face of it one might say it is a surprise that the administration of the UK subsidiary of Toy R Us did not come sooner given the insolvency of its parent in the US some months ago and the well known difficulties of high street retailers in the face of online rivals. One question that may need proper investigation is whether the board acted properly in deferring administration in the face of market pressures (and ongoing losses) in the hope of securing a sale. Given that there is apparently a deficit to both the Revenue and Pension Protection Fund the outcome for trade creditors cannot be good and they may wish a proper investigation to be undertaken by the administrators to determine whether there is culpability here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Toys R Us nearly collapsed last December, before the company agreed to inject an extra \u00c2\u00a39m into its pension fund. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration means Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pension Protection Fund takes over the scheme, which currently has a \u00c2\u00a337m black hole. Ian Browne, pension specialist at Old Mutual Wealth, says existing pensioners will be protected, while current workers will lose some of their pension pot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Members of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension schemes need not panic. When schemes collapse they fall into the hands of the PPF, who have the responsibility for paying workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pensions. Those who already reached the scheme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal pension age will receive 100% of their pension. For those who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached the normal pension age, the PPF will pay 90% of what their pension is worth, up to a cap. This cap is currently just over \u00c2\u00a338,500 per year for someone retiring at 65, so it only affects the highest earners. Members of the scheme can still take early retirement and a tax-free cash lump sum. In fact, the way PPF calculates these can sometimes be more generous than a typical scheme. The problems at Toys R Us show that the era of retail parks may be over. So argues Dr Gordon Fletcher, retail expert at the University of Salford Business School. He says large out-of-town retail parks fail to meet customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With ToysRUs and Maplin going into administration today, the constant change in the retail sector is now being felt in retail parks as much as the high street. These familiar brands have struggled to keep pace with the growing preference for online retail. But it is not just a matter of more people buying online, it is also what these retailers offered as their customer experience. Visiting a toystore with children is generally a fraught experience for most adults. Combined with the fact that a planned visit to a toystore will often require a degree of secrecy from the very same children, the failure of Toys R Us becomes much clearer. With a business model that imitated a grocery superstore that relied primarily on offering competitive pricing points in out-of-town locations there were few opportunities to discover something new or to create an environment that encouraged adult drivers to linger as long as their children wanted to. Our North of England reporter Frances Perraudin reports from a Toys R Us store in Manchester: Late on Wednesday morning, removal men Mark Connor and John Banks have popped into a tired looking Toys \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Us store on the outskirts of Manchester city centre for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nostalgia trip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a relic from the 80s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last time I came here, I was playing with transformers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Connor is keeping his eye out for Lego or Star Wars toys for his five-year-old son, but despite this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that the company would be going into administration, he says prices at the shop in the Ancoats area of the city are still too high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just compared one item they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got over there to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on ebay and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a340 there and you can get it for \u00c2\u00a315 online.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think toy shops like this put smaller toy shops out of business, so I personally think [the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse] might actually give the smaller toy shops a bit of a niche market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Connor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing, because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never a good thing when a big company goes out of business because loads of people lose their jobs, but it might regenerate a local toy shop mentality and help local businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The 30,000 square foot store was earmarked for closure before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, as the area is in line for redevelopment. On Wednesday morning only a small handful of customers could be seen wandering through its aisles of garish toys, with around 15 members of staff standing huddled chatting near the tills. Mike Meszaros, who works in branding, has come into the store to find an outfit for his son for World Book Day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I remember coming in here when I was seven years old and it was busy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d come in and it was like Hamley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have staff demonstrating the toys. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have stuff set up that you could play with and there would be toys everywhere that you could use before you bought them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like that now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite sad really.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour MP Peter Kyle says Maplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration shows the wider impact of the weak pound on UK firms who import goods. Far from ushering in a bright economic future, the threat of Brexit has put jobs and investment at risk. Adam Deacock, a Barrister at Radcliffe Chambers, fears it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be possible to save all Toys R Us and Maplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores. He explains: The administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statutory task is to rescue a company and its business as a going concern if this is possible. In practical terms this is highly unlikely, as a buyer will be unlikely to wish to take over their debts and liabilities or all of their stores, so the administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 next task is to attempt to get the most they can for the assets. The hope for the companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 5,500 employees is that a buyer can be found for the businesses who will take over as many as possible of the stores, their employees and their pensions in one go, but the administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concern is simply to produce the best result for creditors. Deacock points out that the UK government could be hit in the pocket: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As taxpayers we should all be concerned as the immediate cause of Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 administration appears to be its unpaid VAT bill of \u00c2\u00a315m and other unpaid tax debts can be expected. Another interesting tweet from Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien, suggesting that Amazon will profit from Maplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems: Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien of UK Research Director at Global Data Retail reckons that Smyths, Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest toy retailer, was at least partly responsible for Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise. Smyths has been expanding in the UK recently, and almost doubled its UK pre-tax profits last year. It has offered a range of bargain toys, aimed at shoppers on a budget. Pat Lynes, business transformation expert and founder of Sullivan &amp; Stanley, fears that more retailers will follow Maplin and Toys R US. Lynes pins the blame on outdated management who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adjusted to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business conditions: Toys R Us and Maplin facing collapse is sadly not surprising. They haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t re-engineered their operating model to focus on digital platforms and the customer experience. A lot of executives of these older corporations are sitting within organisational structures that were fit for the nineties and maybe the noughties, but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid-pace, changing world. Without the ability to adapt quickly, sales will slide. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same Blockbuster story repeating - how many others will be next? Another example of why high street stores such as Maplin will be missed. Dr Coxon now works at Cambridge University, making silicon solar cells more efficient, so those projects clearly paid off. PwC have confirmed that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken control of Maplin, and are looking for a buyer for some, or all, of the company. They also say that Maplin was hurt by the fall in sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which slumped against rival currencies after the Brexit vote in June 2016. Zelf Hussain, joint administrator and PwC partner, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The challenging conditions in the UK retail sector are well documented. Like many other retailers, Maplin has been hit hard by a slowdown in consumer spending and more expensive imports as the pound has weakened. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our initial focus as administrators will be to engage with parties who may be interested in acquiring all or part of the company. We will continue to trade the business as normal whilst a buyer is sought. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Staff have been paid their February wages and will continue to be paid for future work while the company is in administration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dom Tribe, retail sector specialist at supply chain firm, Vendigital, says Toys R Us failed to keep pace with changing shopping habits, including internet retail. Despite losing significant market share to competitors such as Amazon and Argos, Toys R Us failed to implement an effective E-commerce model with expedited shipping options and also continued to rely on its large warehouses. Opened in the 1980s and 90s, these have proven highly costly to run, with difficulties around managing stock levels, and have been outperformed by its new smaller stores. Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 relationships with key suppliers also hit the headlines over the last year, with the chain demanding long payment terms and exclusivity on certain ranges despite no longer being the key player in the market. Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff has written a good thread about why the collapse of toy stores matters: City analyst Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says retailers are suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153structural game-changers and a softening in consumer confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which can be fatal for firms who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adjusted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toys R Us has officially entered administration, with stores to remain open for the time being. The company failed to adapt and was stuck with a large portfolio of large warehouse shops. No experience for customers, no compelling online presence. A \u00c2\u00a315m VAT bill did for Toys R Us in the end after another poor Christmas, but it was a systemic failure to move with the changes in the retail sector that really did for it. Maplin has also gone into administration in what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a pretty torrid day for UK retail. In both cases the Amazon effect is all too clear to see, but there is more to it than that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are retailers out there who are adapting and prospering. He also points out that Mothercare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen today (currently down 7%, having been 12% lower earlier). Maplin, like Toys R Us, has struggled in the face of online retailers who were able to undercut its prices. But if the company does disappear from the high street, shoppers may struggle to lay their hands on a particular cable, battery or peripheral at short notice: Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, is urging the government to help Maplin and Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devastating that over 5,500 High Street jobs risk being lost. This latest shock in the retail sector continues a worrying trend for our shopping streets and centres. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government must urgently meet with both the unions and the companies to ensure that these jobs are safeguarded. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Workers are suffering stress and anxiety not knowing what the future holds for them. In the event of job losses, the Government must act quickly to ensure all workers receive swift redundancy payments and are properly supported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government must also urgently address problems across the retail sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BREAKING: Electrical goods chain Maplin has also fallen into administration, in an increasingly dark morning for UK retail. This puts around 2,500 jobs at risk. Maplin, which has over 200 stores in the UK, was forced into administration after failing to find new funding -- less than an hour after Toys R US suffered the same fate. Graham Harris, CEO of Maplin, has blamed the slump in the pound since the EU referendum, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can confirm this morning that it has not been possible to secure a solvent sale of the business and as a result we now have no alternative but to enter into an administration process. During this process Maplin will continue to trade and remains open for business. The business has worked hard over recent months to mitigate a combination of impacts from sterling devaluation post Brexit, a weak consumer environment and the withdrawal of credit insurance. This necessitated an intensive search for new capital that in current market conditions has proved impossible to raise. These macro factors have been the principal challenge not the Maplin brand or its market differentiation. We believe passionately that Maplin has a place on the high street, and that our trust, credibility and expertise meets a customer need that is not supported elsewhere. We will now work tirelessly alongside Zelf Hussain, Toby Underwood and Ian Green, from PWC, who have been appointed as the as Joint Administrators of Maplin Electronics Limited, to achieve the best possible outcome for all of our colleagues and stakeholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A whopping VAT tax bill helped to push Toys R Us over the edge. The company owed \u00c2\u00a315m, and a disappointing Christmas trading performance left it without enough funds to pay - triggering its fall into administration. Time for some nostalgia with Geoffrey the Giraffe, who starred in Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s iconic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMagical Place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advert back in 1989: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Davies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breaking news story on Toys R Us: Toys R Us staff discovered earlier this morning that their employer has fallen into administration. Moorfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partner Simon Thomas, who is now running Toys R Us, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have informed employees about the process this morning and will continue to keep them updated on developments. We are grateful for the commitment and hard work of employees as the business continues to trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for Toys R Us customers and staff, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s undoubtedly distressing news for employees of Toys \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Us especially because their fates have been uncertain for so long. Unfortunately they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only retailer that has been struggling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone who is worried about the future of their job should prepare themselves now. Check what redundancy rights you have and dig out any income or mortgage protection policies you hold just in case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toys \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Us have reported they will continue trading for now, however it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently unknown whether they will still accept gift vouchers and offer refunds. If the administrators decide to suspend gift vouchers and refunds and you paid in cash you could be in for a lengthy battle to get your money back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her guide explaining how credit card spending is protected in the UK: How does Section 75 protect your credit card spending? Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, says Toys R Us is another victim of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seismic structural changes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hitting the UK high streets (such as rising operating costs and the threat from online retailers). He adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Put simply, the retailer was too slow to embrace omnichannel, were burdened with too many stores and failed to deliver a retail \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexperience\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 good enough to stand out from their competitors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administrators haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hopes of finding a buyer, for at least some of its 100+ outlets. In the meantime, existing stock will probably be offered at a sharp discount: Toys R Us customers are being urged to cash in any vouchers and gift cards ASAP, following its collapse into administration this morning. Toys R US has been dragged into administration by its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unmanageable rent bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to the Financial Times. It says: Executives had been battling to raise cash to pay a tax liability that fell due this week, but the efforts collapsed after a number of private equity funds and restructuring specialists walked away. Insolvency specialists at Moorfields have begun the process of closing its British operations, which employ nearly 3,000 people and has an estimated funding shortfall of at least \u00c2\u00a325m in its pension scheme. Retail analyst Fiona Paton points out that several other retailers have gone under recently: NEWSFLASH: Retailer Toys R Us has fallen into administration, putting around 3,000 jobs at risk. Press Association has the details: Administrator Moorfields has been appointed to conduct what it called an orderly wind-down of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s store portfolio, although the firm insisted it is still seeking a buyer. Simon Thomas, Moorfields partner, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will be conducting an orderly wind-down of the store portfolio over the coming weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All stores remain open until further notice and stock will be subject to clearance and special promotions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re encouraging customers to redeem their gift cards and vouchers as soon as possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Toys R Us retailer has been hunting for a buyer for several weeks, but without success. The company, which has 105 stores in the UK, is a subsidiary of the eponymous US company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada last year after amassing $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.7bn) of debt. More to follow.... Asia-Pacific markets have closed lower, with Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index down 2%, China off nearly 0.9% and Australia losing 0.7%. London-focused estate agent Foxtons has blamed a plunge in profits on Brexit uncertainty and stamp duty changes that have driven sales in the capital to near record lows. The company said waning consumer confidence against a backdrop of political uncertainty was weighing on the London housing market, driving a 65% fall in pre-tax profits in 2017 to \u00c2\u00a36.5m. Foxtons said changes to rules in 2016, when the government imposed a new stamp duty surcharge on second homes, had also contributed to a weaker market and falling profits. Nic Budden, the chief executive, warned 2018 would be another tough year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are pleased to have delivered a performance in line with market expectations. However, sales activity in the London property market is near historic lows and this had a significant impact on our overall performance in 2017. UK broadcaster ITV has slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after reporting a 10% drop in earnings. Statutory pre-tax profits fell to \u00c2\u00a3500m last year, from \u00c2\u00a3553m in 2016, highlighting the tough market for advertising. ITV blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertain economic environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is overshadowing new CEO Carolyn McCall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrategic refresh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It has also stopped paying a special dividend to shareholders (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still getting a normal divi, though). McCall sounds confident about the future, saying: We have a solid foundation to build on, and a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows gives ITV the flexibility to make the right strategic decisions for the long term future of ITV in an increasingly competitive environment whilst still delivering sustainable returns to shareholders. The prospect of several US interest rate rises this year has also hit American government bonds. As the price of US Treasuries has fallen, the yield (or interest rate) on the bond has risen. If borrowing costs are indeed going up, then investors want a higher return on their money. This means the gap between US and eurozone bonds has hit its widest level since the euro was created. European stock markets are all falling in early trading, as investors react to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony from Fed chair Jerome Powell. The main indices are all down around 0.5% - a modest move, but one that highlights the worries about US interest rates. In London, the FTSE 100 has been pulled down by mining stocks. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re suffering because Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat comments have boosted the US dollar (thus pushing down commodity prices, which are priced in dollars). Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undeniable optimism towards the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and his hawkish comments on interest rate moves, is hurting the markets, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Due to Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong outlook on the US economy, he considers it necessary to continue gradually increasing interest rates in order to prevent the US economy from overheating. On his hawkish tone, when asked the million-dollar question about 3 hikes or 4, Powell was quick to point out the improvements in the economy and his optimism that inflation will reach the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target, in what can only be described as a hawkish response, which to many signalled 4 hikes could be on the cards in 2018. Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments unleashed a wave of anxiety among equity traders, who rushed to sell out of holdings. Vive la France! Statistics body INSEE has just raised its forecast for French growth last year to 2%, up from 1.9%. That confirms that 2017 was the best year for France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy since 2011. INSEE also confirmed that GDP rose by 0.6% in the last three months of 2017, matching its initial estimate. With all this talk about interest rate rises, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that America doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have an inflation problem right now.... Stock markets across Asia have all fallen today, after Fed chair Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish comments reignited interest rate hike fears. The Japanese and Hong Kong indices are leading the selloff, down 1,5% each. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Cautious investors are taking a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guarded approach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM: It is becoming increasingly clear that global stocks still remain highly sensitive to the prospects of rising inflation and interest rate fears. With Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony fuelling market speculation of higher US interest rates this year, stock markets remain exposed to downside risks as equity bears lurk in the background. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders have one thing on their mind today (well two, if you include the snow gripping the capital). How many US interest rates rises are heading our way, and how will the markets cope? For this, we can thank the new head of the Federal Reserve. As we covered in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog, Fed chair Jerome Powell struck an upbeat tone about the US economy when he faced Congress yesterday. Powell told US lawmakers that he has become more optimistic about the US economic outlook since December, predicting some good years ahead with rising wages growth. If he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for Americans, but potentially bad news for investors as the Fed is more likely to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation running out of control. The big fear in the markets is that the Fed could squeeze four rate hikes into 2018, ending the era of cheap money. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: A hawkish Jay Powell indicated US interest rates set to continue to rise in his first public outing as Federal Reserve Chair, prompting many to expect four rate hikes this year rather than three. Shares fell on Wall Street last night after Powell spoke, triggering losses in Asia overnight - and likely falls in Europe today. The FTSE 100 has just opened, down 36 points at 7245. Also coming up today: There could be Brexit fireworks , as the EU publishes the first draft of the withdrawal treaty. This may bring the sticky question of the Irish border into renewed focus - Theresa May has already declared that she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign anything that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153threatens the integrity of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 There could be drama in UK retail too, with Toys R Us and Maplin both on the brink of administration. On the economic side, we get updated growth figures from the US and France, plus the first estimate of eurozone inflation .
