                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. A flurry of manufacturing reports have shown that the global factory sector is in decent health. The eurozone began 2018 strongly, according to data firm Markit. Its Purchasing Managers Index showed that output growth and new orders were strong in January, led by the Netherlands, Austria and Italy. China also seems to have turned a corner, with growth at a 13-month high. But the UK saw a slowdown, as companies wrestled with higher raw material costs. It could be a sign that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate will be higher than hoped this year. The government has held talks with Capita over its financial problems, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning. Minister insist that the company is in better shape than Carillion. Shares in outsourcing firms have fallen sharply again, though. European stock markets have lost ground today, while the US market is also in the red ahead of results from tech giants Apple, Amazon and Alphabet (Google) tonight. Goodnight! GW Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is sliding towards its lowest level of 2018. The blue-chip index is down 37 points at 7496, a drop of 0.5% - a level last seen on 18th December 2017. And finally.... the latest report on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector shows that growth remained strong last month. The US manufacturing PMI, from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), came in at 59.1. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly below December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59.3, but it still shows solid growth. US firms reported that export orders were strong, leading to a backlog of work. However, new orders and production growth slowed, but remained pretty strong. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into another rough day for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outsourcers. Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now down almost 15%, having shed almost half their value yesterday after the firm announced a profit warning. This takes its value down to almost \u00c2\u00a31bn -- not far from the \u00c2\u00a3700m it is hoping to raise in a rights issue. Mitie, another outsourcing firm, are down almost 8% while Serco have lost 5%. DING DING goes the opening bell of the New York stock exchange, setting off a little burst of selling on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 115 points, 0r 0.44%, to 26,034 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is down 0.2%. After a strong January, markets seem to have entered February in a more nervous mooed. Neil Wilson of ETC Capital reckons that rising government bond yields are causing nervousness in the equity markets. The prospect of US interest rate rises are another factor, he adds: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marginally hawkish tilt is undoubtedly a factor. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve given markets the greenlight for a March hike, raising prospects for 4 hikes this year, and are sounding more upbeat on inflation. European stock markets are mostly in the red today, despite the strong performance by eurozone factories last month. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shed 1%, and there are smaller losses in France and London too: Wall Street is expected to open lower too. Yesterday it rallied, after two days of losses. Newsflash from America: US productivity shrank by 0.1% in the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first drop in hourly output per worker since early 2016, and may undermine hopes that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate can be pushed higher. Economists had expected productivity to rise, by 1%. Andy Bruce of Reuters points out that the rise in factory goods prices will probably push UK inflation higher: There are ructions in the UK jobs market today. Morrisons is axing 1,500 roles as it cuts middle-management roles across its supermarkets. It is also creating 1,700 junior positions, in an attempt to improve customer service. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad morning for fans of burger chain Byron too. It is closing 20 stores, or nearly a third of its estate, as part of a rescue deal with creditors. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest Capita story, by Rob Davies: Government officials met executives from the outsourcing firm Capita to discuss its financial problems, it has emerged, as Labour accused ministers of being complacent and warned of similarities between the company and its collapsed rival Carillion. In response to an urgent question from Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business select committee chair, Rachel Reeves, the Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said a crown representative had been appointed to monitor Capita. The move, which came after Capita halved in value following a shock profit downgrade on Wednesday, is part of a procedure designed to help officials monitor the finances of struggling companies that provide public services. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing report: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers showed signs of a slowdown at the start of the year amid rising costs for raw materials, sending factory output to a seven-month low. The Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI index showed activity fell to 55.3 last month from 56.2 in December, missing City forecasts of a further acceleration in growth. However, the PMI remained well above its long-run average of 51.7 and above the 50 mark which separates expansion from contraction. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers have experienced growing demand for orders from China, Japan, the Middle East and North America in recent months. There has also been an upturn in sales in Europe as the continent returns to economic growth after years in the doldrums. The readings come as ministers enter critical talks over trade with Brussels. However, the upswing in demand for goods has prompted rising global demand for raw materials, pushing up the cost of oil, metals, food and chemicals, and further pressuring manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profit margins. The PMI survey showed purchase prices rose at the fastest rate in 11 months in January, and to one of the greatest extents in its history. More here: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing survey also shows that UK factories are being hit by rising prices. Companies reported that chemicals, food products, metals, oil, paper and plastics are all becoming pricier. Many factories are passing those costs onto their clients -- at the fastest pace since last April. That could be a blow to consumers, as inflation is already rising faster than wages. Duncan Brock, of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Purchasers reported that global demand impacted on their costs, with another sharp inflationary rise. Respondents mentioned forward buying as a way of controlling prices and securing supply to remain competitive, but firms also attempted to claw back some of their margins by raising their own prices to clients at a level not seen for nine months. As this charts shows, raw material costs also jumped after the UK referendum (due to the slump in the pound) Elsewhere in the markets, the pound has shrugged off the slowdown in UK factory growth last month. Sterling is up 0.3 of a cent against the US dollar, at $1.422 - close to last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18-month high. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The pound was nonplussed by the decline [in the UK manufacturing PMI], focusing on the positives to hold onto a half a percent climb against the dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically now recovered all of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 0.3% increase against the euro. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much cheer for Capita in that urgent parliamentary question, with the government insisting it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bailed out and Labour MPs calling for public services to be taken back into public control. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much relief in the City either. Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have shed another 6.8% today to just 170p. That looks like their lowest level since October 2002. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Diana Johnson suggests the government sounds like Corporal Jones over Capita (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic! don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic!). Q: If everything\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so rosy, why did Barnet council, a flagship Tory council, put contingency plans into place in case Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems worsen? Dowden denies that the government is complacent. He points out that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency plans worked after Carillion collapsed. Alan Brown, SNP MP, asks about Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension deficit. How big is it, and what will the government do to help? Oliver Dowden says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a matter for Capita; suspending its dividend will help it to put extra funds into the pension pot. Labour MP Thelma Walker says that outsourcing public services has failed. Instead of expensive bailouts, they should be brought into public ownership. Oliver Dowden repeats that the government isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bailing any companies out. Oliver Dowden insists that the state is not bailing Capita out. Instead, shareholders are paying the price of its problems.... Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable nails the problem. If Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own CEO thinks the company is too complex, how can the government monitor the stability and performance of these outsourcing giants? Oliver Dowden replies that the government uses third-parties to assess their performance, and also engages closely with them through the Cabinet Office. Conservative MP Bim Afolami argues that it would be wrong to cancel contracts with Capita just because it issued a profit warning yesterday. Minister Oliver Dowden agrees. He says there would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very few companies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the government could deal with if it shunned every company who issued a profits warning. SNP MP Dierdre Brock, though, argues that Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems shows we should wind back the privatisation of public services. Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden even quotes former Labour PM Gordon Brown, who said that PFI contracts had been necessary to improve Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public services. But shadow cabinet office minister John Trickett criticises the government, accusing it of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153indifference to corporate mismanagement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and complacency in the face of a crisis in the UK outsourcing sector. Over in parliament, Rachel Reeves MP has asked an urgent question about Capita, following the servicing group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning yesterday. Q: Is Capita a threat to the public finances? Oliver Dowden MP, cabinet office minister, insists that Capita is in a very different situation than Carillion (which collapsed earlier this month). Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement from Capita was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balance strengthening move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, not just a profits warning, Dowden says (Capita is looking to raise \u00c2\u00a3700m). We do not believe that Capita is in any way a comparable position to Carillion. Dowden says that government officials met with Capita yesterday, and will work closely with the company to ensure continued delivery of public services. Reeves is unimpressed, saying the government sounds \u00e2\u20ac\u0153muddled and complacent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also disputes that Capita and Carillion aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comparable. Both have debts of \u00c2\u00a31bn, and pension deficits running into the hundreds of millions, Reeves says. Both paid out large shareholder dividends. Both rely on the public purse. Both were audited by KPMG. Both grew through acquisitions, rather than organic growth. Reeves warns: It seems there are more similarities than differences. The slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory growth last month should concern the government, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After a clean sweep of strong manufacturing growth results reported across Europe this morning, Britain are the exception \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bad timing for Prime Minister Theresa May after Brexit-impact documents were leaked earlier this week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those papers claimed there is no post-Brexit deal that benefits the UK economically, and while the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector grew in January, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anywhere near the level of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continental cousins, some of whom saw record highs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Still, growth is growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the optimists will point to UK firms seeing a rise in export orders. However, the seven-month low couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come at a worse time for May, who still faces huge internal Conservative party pressure to keep her job. But Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, is more optimistic: She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The first PMI reading for 2018 points to a good enough start to the year for manufacturers. The index has come off the boil since the end of 2017, but activity across the sector is still expanding at a healthy clip and certainly running ahead of the long-run average. Positive global factors underpinning growth, evident through much of last year, are still very much in play with export demand continuing to put in a strong showing. No ill effects from Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent rally are yet apparent. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says UK firms are being supported by solid order books: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the PMI has dropped for a second consecutive month, it remains above the long term average. It is also higher than the most recent construction and services PMI readings, suggesting manufacturing remains the star pupil in the wider UK economy. UK factories suffered a double-whammy of slowing growth and rising prices last month, says Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit. Dobson, who helped compile today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey, says: Encouragingly, despite the slowdown, the latest survey is consistent with production rising at a solid quarterly rate of around 0.6% in January, with jobs also being added at a faster pace. However, output growth has slowed sharply since last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high, and the more forward-looking new orders index has slipped to a seven-month low. The trend in demand will need to strengthen in the near-term to prevent further growth momentum being lost in the coming months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The biggest advance during the latest survey came on the prices front, with the recent easing in inflationary pressure seeing a sudden sharp reversal. Cost inflation surged to an 11-month high and to one of its highest levels in the series history, as oil prices surged higher and demand for many inputs outpaced supply. Breaking: British factory growth hit a seven-month low last month, as Britain failed to keep pace with the eurozone. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly PMI index of UK manufacturing dropped to 55.3 in January, down from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 56.5. That shows that growth slowed, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still above the long-term average. UK factories say that output growth, and new order growth, both weakened last month. Raw material costs spiked -- pushing input costs up, and forcing UK firms to raise their prices. But more optimistically, UK firms did see a rise in export orders. Markit says: Foreign demand improved at one of the quickest rates over the past four years. There were reports of increased sales to clients in North America, China, mainland Europe, the Middle East and Japan. More to follow... Is the worst really over for Greece? Greek manufacturing output growth hit a ten-year high in January, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI survey. Job creation hit a record high, suggesting Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories are dusting themselves down after the debt crisis. The eurozone boom continues! Factories across the eurozone grew strongly on January, according to data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcheck on the sector. Companies reported strong growth in output and new orders - although not quite as rapidly as in December. Italy, Austria, the Netherlands and Germany led the way, and there are also signs of a recovery in Greece. This means the IHS Markit Eurozone manufacturing PMI came in at 59.6 -- showing strong growth, but down slightly on December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high of 60.6. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data shows that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have now been expanding for 55 months in a row. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing boom continued in full swing in January. Output grew at one of the fastest rates recorded over the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20-year history, matched by a further near-record surge in new orders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employment likewise showed one of the largest gains yet recorded by the survey as firms expanded capacity in line with rising demand. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies also posted strong factory growth last month. Boom! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has posted its strongest growth in seven years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian manufacturing PMI has jumped to 59.0, from 57.4, thanks to a surge in production, strong order book growth, and rising employment. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector started the new year where it ended the old one, with strong manufacturing growth. Markit reports that business conditions in the Spanish manufacturing sector \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued to improve markedly at the start of 2018\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Spanish firms reported that output rose sharply, amid a jump in new orders. They hired more staff -- good news for Spanish unemployment. Encouragingly, Spanish bosses are optimistic about their prospects this year. Andrew Harker, associate director at IHS Markit, says the recovery means firms will be forced to hike prices, as they scramble to get their hands on raw materials. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A jump in business confidence suggests that firms see little reason to doubt the sustainability of the current upturn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strong demand conditions are bringing with them increased inflationary pressures amid shortages of raw materials, while higher oil prices were also mentioned. Both input costs and output prices rose at sharper rates in January.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting some strong manufacturing figures from eurozone companies this morning. The Netherland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory PMI has hit a record high for January, at a stratospheric 62.5 (anything over 50 shows growth). Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory PMI remained close to December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high, at 57.6. Over in the markets, the bond selloff is continuing. The interest rate on 10-year German government debt has hit its highest level since 2015 (yields, or interest rates, rise when bond prices fall). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still just 0.7% - a really cheap rate, but this means anyone who bought the bonds recently is sitting on a loss. Earlier this week, the five-year German bond yield turned positive for the first time since 2015 -- meaning Berlin actually has to pay to borrow.... Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories made a good start to 2018, according to Markit. The Russian manufacturing PMI rose to 52.1 in January, from 52.0 in December. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories are roaring ahead, at the fastest pace in four years. The Japanese manufacturing PMI has jumped to 54.8 in January, up from 54.0 in December, a level that signals a strong expansion. Firms reported that output and new order growth rates accelerated last month. This led to rising backlogs of work, even though firms took on more staff - and passed rising costs onto customers. Joe Hayes, Economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, says the picture looks bright. New business opportunities increased at the sharpest rate in four years, supporting the quickest rise in output since February 2014. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Businesses appeared to derive confidence from the robust economic backdrop that official data has depicted, with optimism strengthening to a four- month high. In turn, this supported an accelerated rate of job creation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector fared last month, as data firm IHS Markit releases its monthly PMI reports. These surveys are based on interviews with purchasing managers across the globe, and give an insight into how factories are performing. And the early signs are encouraging! China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector grew at its fastest pace in 13 months, according to the Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI. It hit 51.5 for January - matching December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading - which means the sector has strengthened for eight months in a row. Chinese firms reported a rise in new work and new orders, leading to an increase in output. But they also kept cutting jobs, as companies looked to downsize in the face of pressure from Beijing to cut pollution. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong of CEBM Group says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The manufacturing industry had a good start to 2018. Going forward, we should keep a close eye on the stability of the demand side.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors will be keen to see Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data from across the eurozone, and the UK, to see how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy began 2018. European markets are expected to open higher, after dropping earlier this week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 9am GMT: Eurozone factory PMI for January 9.30am GMT: UK factory PMI for January 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 3pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI reports",

And, luckily for the ailing dollar, the numbers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint: the headline figure came in at 200k, far higher than both the 181k expected and the 160k posted in January, with wage growth also outperforming forecasts to remain unchanged at 0.3%. </p> <p>This, alongside a better than expected consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan, allowed the dollar to regain some ground lost this week. Against the pound the greenback rose 1%, sending cable back below $1.413, while against the euro the dollar jumped 0.7%, taking the currency away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.25-crossing 3 and a bit year peak. </p> <p>All this hawkishness was toxic for the Dow Jones, which plunged 300 points once the bell rang on Wall Street to hit 25900 for the first time in over a fortnight. This Dow drop only exacerbated the losses in Europe; the DAX and CAC both fell 1.3%, with the former on track for its worst close since September last year, while the FTSE slipped 0.7% to strike a sub-7450, near 8 week nadir. </p> <p>As for Bitcoin, while things are still bad, they are nowhere near as disastrous as they were at lunchtime. It had at one point found itself trading at $7750, a price not seen since the end of November, only for a wave of buyers to rescue it from those lows and send it back above $8650. Still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly been a week to forget for the cryptocurrency, with a hat-trick of bad news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a shift in regulations in South Korea, a Facebook ban on ads for the product, and an investigation by the US CFTC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c causing it to shed around $3000 per Bitcoin. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a748180e4b08ad1ec3ee490\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:21:11.069Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With the dollar recovering in the expectation of an imminent US interest rate rise, the pound has lost some of its recent gains.</p> <p>Sterling is down more than 1% on the day against the dollar to $1.4119, its biggest daily fall since November last year.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a748009e4b0839ae39a8564\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:17:46.392Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The university of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey may have come in better than expected but it did show the consumer sentiment index at its lowest level since September. However chief economist Richard Curtin was positive about the overall picture:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumer sentiment has remained largely unchanged for more than a year at very favorable levels. The January Sentiment figure was just 0.2 Index-points below December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and just 1.1 points below the 2017 average of 96.8--which was the highest yearly average since 2000. Stock price increases and the passage of tax reforms were mentioned by all-time record numbers of consumers. To be sure, there were small offsetting declines among lower income households and residents of the Northeast.</p> <p> Consumers continued to expect growth in jobs and incomes, but anticipated a slightly higher inflation rate. Importantly, the motivating force behind purchase decisions has shifted from discounts on prices and interest rates to increased confidence in future job security and growth in wages as well as financial assets.

It has naturally sparked questions of whether a larger correction is in store. The Dow Jones has pulled back 3% while the FTSE 100 has dropped nearly 4.5%. These are relatively small moves and based on recent experience, the mostly likely scenario is dip-buyers step in to send markets back up again. However, maybe this time will be different. The market has reached some new extremes in sentiment during January and certain risk-factors, notably the rise in bond yields, could point to further stock market declines.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conceivable that the Bitcoin bubble bursting has meant retail equity investors were meeting less margin calls.</p> <p>Rising bond yields have put stock markets on high alert. 2.6% was the first \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworry level\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in 10-year US treasuries. A 3% 10-year treasury yield is the big kahuna for a larger stock market correction. After many stops and starts in US interest rate rises, investors increasingly seem to be feeling like this tightening cycle could be here to stay. The phenomenon is global though. The UK gilt yield has hit its highest since May 2016. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yield hit a fresh 22-month high.

Economist James Knightley says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US jobs report is very strong with payrolls rising 200,000 versus expectations of 180,000. There were some chunky upward revisions too, but the big story is wage growth which looks much, much better. Wages are now growing 2.9% year on year (the fastest rate of growth since 2009) with last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised up to 2.7% from 2.5%. Unemployment stays at 4.1%, but given the strength of this report it is hard to argue against a March Fed rate hike now.</p> <p>Wage growth has been the missing link in the strong economic growth, tight jobs market story. We have been hoping for some time to see a turnaround and it does finally look as though something is happening. It backs up evidence from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Federation of Independent Businesses small business survey, which showed the net proportion of businesses raising worker compensation is at its highest since 2000. The report also showed you have to go all the way back to 1989 to find when the index indicating the net proportion of businesses that plan to raise worker pay was higher. </p> <p>Given companies such as WalMart have credited Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts as a way for them to afford higher worker pay we suspect we will see the wage numbers pick-up further. Rising wages and robust economic growth is also supportive for our 3% headline CPI call for this summer.</p> <p>Consequently, it will need a big shock to prevent the Fed from hiking in March, but it could happen in the form of a damaging government shutdown should politicians fail to resolve their differences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next deadline is February 8. Nonetheless, it looks more and more likely that we will have to revise up our call for three Fed rate hikes this year to four.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a746cb2e4b08ad1ec3ee381\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T13:52:48.966Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US firms are facing a real scramble to find staff to hire, reckons Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joebrusuelas/status/959423304594575360\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US January NFP: Strong Employment Report.

Selling pressure at the moment is intense as there has been nothing but bad news for bitcoin bulls of late.</p> <p>The key concern facing the bulls is the CFTC investigation into Tether and the Bitfinex exchange. Claims of full dollar convertibility are under scrutiny. Given there are about 2bn tether coins in existence, there should be a $2bn account somewhere but Tether has yet to prove it or have accounts audited.</p> <p>The idea that Tether is creating coins to buy bitcoin is straight out of satire. If bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then this is Ponzi squared; printing fake money to buy a different type of fake money in order to ramp up the price of the latter. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to cause real world losses for many investors it would be hilarious.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we see the jaws of the regulatory crunch closing on other fronts with moves to ban or greatly restrict trading on bitcoin gaining traction worldwide.

This would boost small businesses, and tackle the uncompetitive nature of the current outsourcing market. It would also protect the government from another Carillion crisis.</p> <p>Secondly, public contracts should not be awarded solely on the basis of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value for money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Government contracts should be seen as an opportunity to create public value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where value is understood in holistic rather than narrow economistic terms. The government should account for the wider economic and social impact of its suppliers when determining which supplier should be awarded a particular contract. The Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals to account for the quantity and quality of employment created by a supplier, the nature of its corporate governance, its environmental impact and its attitude towards tax suggests how this could be done.</p> <p>Thirdly, we need to call time on private financing. If the government wants to build a major infrastructure project it should do so through historically cheap public borrowing, on the public balance sheet, justifying the investment based on the economic, social, or environmental impact. Good public investment done well more than pays for itself in the long run. It should also expand its definition of investment to include investment in human as well as physical capital \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spending on healthcare and education is just as much of an investment in the long-run economic capacity of this country as investments in roads and bridges.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2018/02/problem-outsourcing-not-carillion-market-itself\">The problem with outsourcing is not Carillion but the market itself</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a743884e4b0839ae39a81dc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T10:12:34.890Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Carillion: 377 staff made redundant</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NEWSFLASH: Nearly 400 Carillion staff have just been made redundant, following its fall into liquidation last month.</strong></p> <p>The Official Receiver says it has managed to save more than 900 jobs, but 377 more have lost their jobs.

                "bodyText":"New York traders will be catching their breath and counting their losses after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines. So, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our updated news story on the markets today: Wall Street ended its worst week in two years on Friday with another sharp fall as markets in Europe also continued to tumble from the record-high levels reached less than a month ago. Investors headed for the exits amid growing fears over a bond market rout, triggered by early signs of inflation in the US as economic growth accelerates and wages appear to finally be rising after years of stagnation. US government bond yields, which rise as prices fall, hit the highest level since January 2014. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665 points to end the day down more than 2.5% and falling below 26,000, the record level it hit on 17 January. The sell-off came after the US labor department released a better than expected monthly jobs report, sparking fears of a sharper rise in interest rates. It was the first time since June 2016 that the Dow had fallen more than 500 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all from us for this week. Thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight! Bitcoin, incidentally, is still off its earlier lows. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 5% today at $8,556. The Dow finished 665.75 points lower. So it you round it down..... Each of the 30 companies on the Dow fell today. The worst performers were Chevron (-5.5%), Exxon (-5.1%) and Goldman Sachs (-4.5%). Tech stocks also had a bad day, with Apple down 4.3%. Over on the Nasdaq (which lost 2%), Alphabet slid by 5% after Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company missed expectations with its financial results last night. What caused the selloff? There are several factors, but the most significant may be today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report - showing wages rose by 2.9% over the last year. That increase in earnings could push up inflation, forcing US interest rates higher. It was a poor week for the S&amp;P 500 (a broader stock market index than the Dow) Traders on Wall Street will be nursing bruises; the Dow has lost 1,095 point this week. This looks like the third-biggest one-day points decline on the Dow ever! It also looks like the biggest points decline since the aftermath of Lehman Brothers collapse. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that historic. In percentage terms, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls are much less dramatic - but still a concern... NEWSFLASH: The US stock market has recorded its worst week in two years, after a wave of selling hit Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has tumbled by almost 670 points, or 2.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest percentage fall since June 2016, the day after the Brexit vote, and means the Dow has shed over 1,000 points this week. One important point - a 600-point plunge isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what it used to be, due to the strong market rally over the last 15 month. Wall Street is staggering towards the finishing line.... with five minutes to go, the Dow is down 675 points or 2,5%. Inflation fears, worries about the bond market, and rising political tensions are all hitting the markets today, according to CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest market report. Ken Odeluga, market analyst with City Index in London says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a smorgasbord of negativity...It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been pretty nervous all week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier today, president Trump approved the release of a memo alleging that the FBI had been biased against Trump over their investigations into possible Russian interference in the US elections. That move is weighing on investors, according to Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities. He warns: There looks like a breakdown of the institutions in our country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No matter what side you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Dow is now at a three-week low: Make that a 624-point fall...! Heading into the last hour of trading, the Dow is now down 576 points, or 2.2%. This could be the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst day since the aftermath of the Brexit vote.... The selloff is gathering speed! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down by 500 points, or almost 2%. Oil giant Exxon is still the biggest faller, down 5.5%, followed by Chevron (-4.1%) and Apple (-3.4%). Investors seem to be increasingly spooked by the prospect of US interest rate rises, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent US jobs report - which showed a pick-up in hiring and wages. Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, explains: A big wage growth number is the biggest risk to the stock market rally, because it means the Fed may get more aggressive in raising interest rates. Here are a few photos from Wall Street, as traders try to keep pace with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our colleague Richard Partington on the stock market losses today: Wall Street was heading for its worst week in two years on Friday as markets in Europe also continued to tumble from record-high levels reached less than a month ago. Investors headed for the exits amid growing fears over a bond market rout, triggered by early signs of inflation in the US as economic growth accelerates. US government bond yields, which rise as prices fall, hit the highest level since January 2014. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 400 points in early trading in New York, hitting a low of 25,787. Amid a widespread sell-off, the biggest fallers were Apple, Visa and oil firms Exxon and Chevron. In Europe, the FTSE 100 recorded its worst week since April last year when Theresa May called the snap election, dropping by 47 points to 7,443, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax fell 1.7%. The worst week for stocks under Donald Trump comes after one of the best years in history for shares in 2017 and just a week after the Dow hit a record high of 26,617. More here: With two and a half hours trading to go, Wall Street is solidly in the red. The Dow is down 1.5%, or almost 400 points, at 25,789 points. The wider S&amp;P 500 is off 1.1%, while the Nasdaq has lost almost 1%. Given the losses earlier this week, Marketwatch agrees that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on track for the worst weekly losses in two years. The markets in Mexico, Brazil and Canada are also having a bad day.... US wages may be growing, but so is inequality, says Dominic Rushe It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a long, slow recovery for US workers but wages finally appear to be growing again, according to the latest jobs report released on Friday. But behind the headline rate the figures show \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that inequality is on the rise. On Friday the labor department released its latest monthly jobs update. The US added 200,000 new positions in January, higher than expected, but the real surprise was in wage growth. Hourly earnings rose 0.3% in January, enough to lift the annual rate up to 2.9%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This may be the start of a welcome trend in wage gains, and marks the highest percentage increase in average hourly earnings since 2009,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said US secretary of labour Alexander Acosta. A tightening labour market and unemployment at 4.1% (a 17-year low) appears finally to be making its way into people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets as employers are forced to raise wages in order to attract talent. But the big numbers hide an ominous trend. For many Americans, slow wage growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a hangover of the post-2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great recession\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For those without a college degree the sluggish rate of growth can be traced back to the 1970s, and the more recent slump deepened that inequality. The full report is here: It was a bad day all round for global markets. The FTSE 100, as we mentioned earlier, has suffered its worst week since last April With poor results from Deutsche Bank to add to those of Daimler earlier this week, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has also dropped sharply, recording its biggest weekly fall since February 2016. And Wall Street continues to come under the cosh, as the better than expected jobs and confidence numbers add to the belief that interest rises are on the way. Investors have begun to take seriously the fact that central banks are removing the financial punchbowl which has powered markets for the past few years, and perhaps at a faster pace than had been expected. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 46.96 points or 0.63% to 7443.43 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.68% to 12,785.16 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.64% lower at 5364.98 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished down 1.44% at 23,202.66 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.81% lower at 10,211.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 358 points or 1.37%. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 384 points. The FTSE 100 has closed down 0.63% at 7443.43, as part of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global market sell 0ff. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is down 2.9%, making it the worst weekly performance since 21 April last year when it lost....2.91%. That incidentally was the week Theresa May decided to call a snap UK general election. Happy days. A quick summary of how bad it has been this week for US markets: Back with bitcoin, and it has been through the classic rollercoaster ride today. Having fallen as low as $7625 it is now actually in positive territory for the day, up 0.12% at $9010. More on the disparities in the US wage growth data: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US open made a miserable day all the worse for the European markets, while Bitcoin managed to pull back from the brink. Following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish hold from the Federal Reserve, there was arguably more interest in this non-farm Friday than there has been for a while. And, luckily for the ailing dollar, the numbers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint: the headline figure came in at 200k, far higher than both the 181k expected and the 160k posted in January, with wage growth also outperforming forecasts to remain unchanged at 0.3%. This, alongside a better than expected consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan, allowed the dollar to regain some ground lost this week. Against the pound the greenback rose 1%, sending cable back below $1.413, while against the euro the dollar jumped 0.7%, taking the currency away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.25-crossing 3 and a bit year peak. All this hawkishness was toxic for the Dow Jones, which plunged 300 points once the bell rang on Wall Street to hit 25900 for the first time in over a fortnight. This Dow drop only exacerbated the losses in Europe; the DAX and CAC both fell 1.3%, with the former on track for its worst close since September last year, while the FTSE slipped 0.7% to strike a sub-7450, near 8 week nadir. As for Bitcoin, while things are still bad, they are nowhere near as disastrous as they were at lunchtime. It had at one point found itself trading at $7750, a price not seen since the end of November, only for a wave of buyers to rescue it from those lows and send it back above $8650. Still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly been a week to forget for the cryptocurrency, with a hat-trick of bad news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a shift in regulations in South Korea, a Facebook ban on ads for the product, and an investigation by the US CFTC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c causing it to shed around $3000 per Bitcoin. With the dollar recovering in the expectation of an imminent US interest rate rise, the pound has lost some of its recent gains. Sterling is down more than 1% on the day against the dollar to $1.4119, its biggest daily fall since November last year. The university of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey may have come in better than expected but it did show the consumer sentiment index at its lowest level since September. However chief economist Richard Curtin was positive about the overall picture: Consumer sentiment has remained largely unchanged for more than a year at very favorable levels. The January Sentiment figure was just 0.2 Index-points below December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and just 1.1 points below the 2017 average of 96.8--which was the highest yearly average since 2000. Stock price increases and the passage of tax reforms were mentioned by all-time record numbers of consumers. To be sure, there were small offsetting declines among lower income households and residents of the Northeast. Consumers continued to expect growth in jobs and incomes, but anticipated a slightly higher inflation rate. Importantly, the motivating force behind purchase decisions has shifted from discounts on prices and interest rates to increased confidence in future job security and growth in wages as well as financial assets. This renewed sense of confidence was responsible for the recent declines in savings rates. he tax cuts will increase discretionary spending once higher energy bills due to the unusually cold weather are paid. Monetary policy will need to tighten in the year ahead, but given consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decade long experience with record low interest rates, only modest increases in interest rates will be sufficient to curb any excesses. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.8% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018. The upbeat consumer confidence figures have sent Wall Street even lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 300 points or more than 1.1%. More positive news for the US economy, adding to the belief that the Federal Reserve will be ready to raise interest rates next month. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 95.7 in January, up from an initial reading of 94.4 and better than the expected figure of 95. It was however slightly lower than December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final reading of 95.9. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, suggests the slump in bitcoin could be one of the reasons for the current weakness in global stock markets: Markets participants found themselves in the rare position of witnessing falling prices this week. It has naturally sparked questions of whether a larger correction is in store. The Dow Jones has pulled back 3% while the FTSE 100 has dropped nearly 4.5%. These are relatively small moves and based on recent experience, the mostly likely scenario is dip-buyers step in to send markets back up again. However, maybe this time will be different. The market has reached some new extremes in sentiment during January and certain risk-factors, notably the rise in bond yields, could point to further stock market declines. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conceivable that the Bitcoin bubble bursting has meant retail equity investors were meeting less margin calls. Rising bond yields have put stock markets on high alert. 2.6% was the first \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworry level\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in 10-year US treasuries. A 3% 10-year treasury yield is the big kahuna for a larger stock market correction. After many stops and starts in US interest rate rises, investors increasingly seem to be feeling like this tightening cycle could be here to stay. The phenomenon is global though. The UK gilt yield has hit its highest since May 2016. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yield hit a fresh 22-month high. Rising interest rates mean the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoldilocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario for markets is warming up to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdaddy bear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As expected US markets are in negative territory after the better than expected jobs figures gave a boost to the flagging dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 217 points or 0.8%, on track for its worst weekly performance since January 2016..The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.6% while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.55% lower. The rise in average earnings is not spread across the board: Here are the jobs data charts: Pantheon economist Ian Shepherdson reckons the jobs data should be good for shares. Wall Street futures have improved as we approach the opening of the US market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now forecast to open around 200 points lower, better than the 250 loss predicted in the immediate aftermath of the better than expected jobs figures. Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab expects US rate rises this year. And increased market volatility: The US economy started 2018 on a positive note as the labour market continues to tighten. This latest set of job numbers supports the view that that some of the weakness in December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service-providing industries would revert in January. Tightening labour market conditions and indications of a pickup in wage growth will be welcomed by the Fed which has expressed concern over benign inflation. While the Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday, we expect a hike in March as Jerome Powell is expected to continue down the familiar path of keeping inflation under control without raising rates so far or so fast as to stifle the improvement in growth expected this year. We continue to believe the Fed will hike rates at least three times this year and that, along with the paring of its balance sheet, historically-low financial conditions may start to tighten. However, with the outlook for inflation continuing to be carefully monitored, we do expect a higher level of volatility in the stock market this year relative to 2017. The big picture is that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been creating jobs each month since early into Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held steady under Donald Trump too. The upbeat US jobs figures makes it likely there will be an interest rate rise in March barring unforeseen circumstances, according to ING Bank. Economist James Knightley says: The US jobs report is very strong with payrolls rising 200,000 versus expectations of 180,000. There were some chunky upward revisions too, but the big story is wage growth which looks much, much better. Wages are now growing 2.9% year on year (the fastest rate of growth since 2009) with last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised up to 2.7% from 2.5%. Unemployment stays at 4.1%, but given the strength of this report it is hard to argue against a March Fed rate hike now. Wage growth has been the missing link in the strong economic growth, tight jobs market story. We have been hoping for some time to see a turnaround and it does finally look as though something is happening. It backs up evidence from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Federation of Independent Businesses small business survey, which showed the net proportion of businesses raising worker compensation is at its highest since 2000. The report also showed you have to go all the way back to 1989 to find when the index indicating the net proportion of businesses that plan to raise worker pay was higher. Given companies such as WalMart have credited Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts as a way for them to afford higher worker pay we suspect we will see the wage numbers pick-up further. Rising wages and robust economic growth is also supportive for our 3% headline CPI call for this summer. Consequently, it will need a big shock to prevent the Fed from hiking in March, but it could happen in the form of a damaging government shutdown should politicians fail to resolve their differences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next deadline is February 8. Nonetheless, it looks more and more likely that we will have to revise up our call for three Fed rate hikes this year to four. US firms are facing a real scramble to find staff to hire, reckons Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM. President Trump will probably enjoy today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While criticism of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embattled White House continues to mount, job growth continues to go through the gears, with the latest nonfarm payroll figures proving job creation remains a competence within the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capabilities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buoyant domestic and global demand, particularly for the manufacturing sector, appear the drivers in higher-than-anticipated numbers, and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal stimulus package is clearly a shot in the arm for economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, with the economy close to full employment, increased pressure on wages looks an inevitable consequence. So higher inflation is surely on the cards, with taller interest rates set to arrive over the coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A good jobs report = falling shares and bonds. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because traders suspect it means US interest rates will rise faster than expected, as inflation worries encourage central bankers to empty the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpunch bowl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of loose monetary policy. Financial experts like the look of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US labor market report. This is from Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX.com: Jeremy Cook of World First and Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Economics are both impressed by the wage growth: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeanna Smialek suggests that the Phillips curve may not be dead after all (the idea that inflation rises when unemployment falls). Economist Shaun Richards has spotted that bars and restaurants hired more staff last month: The dollar has climbed and US bond yields have risen following the better then expected jobs and wages figures. But the expected opening losses on Wall Street have increased according to the future market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open down around 250 points. Before the jobs data it was around 220 points lower. The dollar index has risen 0.3% to 88.95 while 10 year Treasury yields have hit a near four year high at 2.818%. And the price of 30 year bonds has fallen more than a point with yields at their highest level since March 2017. BREAKING: The US economy created 200,000 new jobs last month, a little more than Wall Street had expected. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure have been revised up too, to 160,000 new jobs (from 146,000). The US jobless rate remains at 4.1%, a 17-year low. Wages rose too, by 0.3% during the month and a healthy 2.9% year-on-year (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average hourly earnings) It looks like a pretty decent jobs report, at first glance. Well, this rather sums up the crypto bubble. Long Blockchain Corp -- formally known as Long Island Iced Tea -- has announced that it has abandoned plans to buy bitcoin mining equipment. Long Island rebranded itself as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblockchain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 company late last year, a move that caused its share price to quadruple. It is pressing on with its proposed merger with technology companyStater Blockchain Limited, but has ditched plans to buy \u00e2\u20ac\u01531,000 Antminer S9 mining rigs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to mine new bitcoins. More here.... Tension is building in the markets as investors brace for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report, due at 8.30am East Coast time (1.30pm in the UK). As usual, Wall Street experts have a range of predictions. The consensus is that 180,000 new jobs were created in January. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the wage growth figures that could move the markets; a (welcome) rise in earnings would make US interest rate rises more likely -- potentially bad news for bond prices and shares too. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide, and Nouriel Roubini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns:: Hold onto your hats. Bitcoin is clambering off the mat, and bouncing back to $8,500. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a 5% loss today, though... This is turning into a rather bad day for digital currencies. Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin et al are all suffering double-digit losses. Despite the recent plunge, bitcoin is still worth rather more than a year ago.... Bitcoin is being hit by two different issues (as explained earlier). Firstly, you have the growing threat of regulation, with India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister pledging yesterday to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceliminate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the use of digital currencies by criminals. That follows similar similar warnings from politicians in the UK, US and South Korea. Secondly, you have the investigation into Bitfinex (a leading digital currency exchange), and crypto firm tether. Regulators are questioning whether tether, whose coins are used to trade digital currency, are actually fully backed by US dollars as it claims. As Bloomberg explains: Tether\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coins have become a popular substitute for dollars on cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, with about $2.3 billion of the tokens outstanding as of Tuesday. While Tether has said all of its coins are backed by U.S. dollars held in reserve, the company has yet to provide conclusive evidence of its holdings to the public or have its accounts audited. Skeptics have questioned whether the money is really there. This double-dose of bad news is sparking a rout across the sector, sending bitcoin sliding through $8,000 (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $7,888 right now). Neil Wilson of ETX Capital reckons that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the wheels are coming off the bitcoin bandwagon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The regulatory crunch appears closer than ever and sooner or later this market could be headed back down to earth. Selling pressure at the moment is intense as there has been nothing but bad news for bitcoin bulls of late. The key concern facing the bulls is the CFTC investigation into Tether and the Bitfinex exchange. Claims of full dollar convertibility are under scrutiny. Given there are about 2bn tether coins in existence, there should be a $2bn account somewhere but Tether has yet to prove it or have accounts audited. The idea that Tether is creating coins to buy bitcoin is straight out of satire. If bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then this is Ponzi squared; printing fake money to buy a different type of fake money in order to ramp up the price of the latter. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to cause real world losses for many investors it would be hilarious. Meanwhile, we see the jaws of the regulatory crunch closing on other fronts with moves to ban or greatly restrict trading on bitcoin gaining traction worldwide. Ultimately if the CFTC decides bitcoin prices have been manipulated it casts a huge shadow of bitcoin and entire crypto market. At Davos last week, a series of experts cast doubt over bitcoin -- those predictions seem to be being born out today.... Ouch! Bitcoin has just tumbled through the $8,000 mark. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now trading at $7985 on the Bitstamp exchange, down over 11% this morning as volatile trading continues to rock the digital currency sector. This inflicts further losses on those who bought into bitcoin late last year. Bitcoin has now lost around 40% of its value this year (bitcoin started the New Year at $13,880), and 60% since its all-time peak in December. The US stock market is heading for another bath. The Dow Jones is being called down around 220 points, or 0.8%, amid nervousness ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll jobs report. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index is now down 1.1% - and facing its biggest weekly loss since the US presidential election in November 2016. In London, the FTSE 100 is extending its recent losses. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down another 28 points, or 0.3%, at 7461, its lowest level since 15 December. Investors are ignoring last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results from Amazon, in favour of fretting about the bond market again. Bond yields (which rise when prices fall) are climbing, on the back of concerns that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts will drive up US borrowing. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says trading is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rocky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe today. He points to the volatility in the bond market, where UK and German government debt has weakened: Gilt yields are at their highest since May 2015 and Bunds at their highest since September 2015. This may well be contributing to the declines we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen recently across Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with the corresponding appreciation of the euro and pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and could now be taking its toll on US stocks. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily mean we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve entered a risk-off period or that stocks are headed for a correction but a sharp rise in yields, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen, can also weigh on equity markets. The FT has a good take on the anxiety in the bond markets: The US is heading into some of its biggest budget deficits outside of wars and recessions as Congress debates increasing ceilings on federal spending on top of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trillion-dollar tax cuts. Lawmakers are contemplating lifting caps on defence and non-defence spending as they seek a funding deal in coming weeks. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a non-partisan think-tank, predicts that Congress will settle on plans that drive the deficit to 5.7 per cent of US gross domestic product in 2019 as annual borrowing exceeds $1.1tn. That would be well short of deficits as a share of GDP reached after the Great Recession or the second world war. But it would be comparable to the shortfall after the recession of the early 1980s under Ronald Reagan, even though the US is now at or beyond full employment and the global economy is in its strongest upswing in a decade.

Economics professor Nouriel Roubini has just been on Bloomberg TV, blasting bitcoin as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest Ponzi scheme in human history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Roubini claims that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charlatans and swindlers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drove digital currencies to record levels last year, before cashing their profits. Ordinary punters, who bought bitcoin when it was trading around $20,000, have lost 60% of their shirts since, says Roubini. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Davies on the job losses at Carillion: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good piece in the New Statesman today about the problems in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outsourcing sector, and the lessons to be learned. In it, Grace Blakeley argues that the demise of Carillion, and Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial problems, show that the outsourcing market is failing, and must change. Blakeley says: Firstly, rather than granting contracts to a small number of huge multinationals which then commission other, smaller specialist firms to do the work, the government should get rid of the middle man and deal with suppliers directly. This would boost small businesses, and tackle the uncompetitive nature of the current outsourcing market. It would also protect the government from another Carillion crisis. Secondly, public contracts should not be awarded solely on the basis of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value for money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Government contracts should be seen as an opportunity to create public value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where value is understood in holistic rather than narrow economistic terms. The government should account for the wider economic and social impact of its suppliers when determining which supplier should be awarded a particular contract. The Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals to account for the quantity and quality of employment created by a supplier, the nature of its corporate governance, its environmental impact and its attitude towards tax suggests how this could be done. Thirdly, we need to call time on private financing. If the government wants to build a major infrastructure project it should do so through historically cheap public borrowing, on the public balance sheet, justifying the investment based on the economic, social, or environmental impact. Good public investment done well more than pays for itself in the long run. It should also expand its definition of investment to include investment in human as well as physical capital \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spending on healthcare and education is just as much of an investment in the long-run economic capacity of this country as investments in roads and bridges. More here: The problem with outsourcing is not Carillion but the market itself NEWSFLASH: Nearly 400 Carillion staff have just been made redundant, following its fall into liquidation last month. The Official Receiver says it has managed to save more than 900 jobs, but 377 more have lost their jobs. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now being told to contact the JobCentre. The employees whose jobs have been saved work on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infrastructure, central and local government, and construction contracts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They are now being transferred to new employees who have taken on these contracts. Carillion employed almost 20,000 staff in the UK, so thousands more Carillion workers still face an uncertain future. A spokesperson for the Official Receiver says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As part of the ongoing liquidation of the Carillion group I am pleased we have been able to safeguard the jobs of 919 employees today. Most staff are transferring on existing or similar terms and I will continue to facilitate this wherever possible as we work to find new providers for Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other contracts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite best efforts it has not been possible to secure the jobs of 377 staff, who will be made redundant. Those affected will be entitled to make a claim for statutory redundancy payments. The Jobcentre Plus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Rapid Response Service stands ready to support any of these employees by providing advice and information so people can move into a new job as quickly as possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I recognise that this will be a worrying time for all those affected, their families and local communities. I would like to thank all staff for their professionalism throughout the liquidation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am expecting many employees working on other Carillion contracts to transfer in the coming weeks and we are continuing to keep the workforce updated as these are arrangements are finalised.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, fears that we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the full impact of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse yet. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply says political and economic uncertainty is hitting the UK construction sector, pushing it towards stagnation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The blocks to progress included a sharp rise in costs and a shortage of key materials, which contributed to longer lead times as supplier capabilities were stretched to their limits. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against this challenging backdrop, though larger orders from cautious clients also failed to materialise, firms retained a sunny disposition with optimism at a seven-month high and a slight rise in employment continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With construction teetering on the edge of contraction, this surprise outcome will serve as a jolt to policymakers, that the impact of political and economic uncertainty remains large at the beginning of 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sam Teague, Economist at IHS Markit, says there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much New Year cheer in the building sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI data indicated a difficult start to 2018 for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector, underlined by business activity growth slumping to a four-month low and new orders sliding back into decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A contraction in house building added to lacklustre commercial building and civil engineering markets, and reduced inflows of new work suggest overall activity could slip into decline in February. Furthermore, cost pressures remained intense, fuelled by shortages of input materials and high costs for imported products. Max Jones, global corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says the collapse of Carillion has hit the construction sector. Jones explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has clearly been a month like no other for the sector, so this drop in the PMI reading comes as no major surprise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation has rippled down the supply chain and shaken confidence across the industry. There have inevitably been fears for the sub-contractors with exposure to the collapse, though some have drawn down on emergency support from banks, including the \u00c2\u00a350m Lloyds fund. Tens of thousands of small construction companies, and other suppliers, across the UK were hit by Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock liquidation in early January. Work was halted at two major hospitals, while other firms were forced to lay off staff as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to be paid for work carried out for Carillion. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry has slowed to near stagnation, and housebuilding is in decline. Data firm Markit reports that UK building companies experienced a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subdued start to 2018\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with total industry activity barely rising. Its monthly construction PMI, which measures activity, dropped to just 50.2 for January from 52.2 in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worryingly closed to the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. In another blow, housebuilding activity shrank - while civil engineering work picked up. Job creation across the construction industry also slowed, to an 18-month low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fresh hit to apprentices already reeling from the collapse of Carillion last month. Markit says: A return to contraction in residential building activity was accompanied by near-stagnant commercial and civil engineering activity. New orders declined, linked by many companies to market uncertainty. On a more positive note, confidence towards future growth prospects improved, with many firms anticipating an increase in new project wins later in the year. More to follow... This is turning into bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst week since 2013.... Of course, bitcoin has always bounced back from its previous slumps (five years ago it was worth just $20). But is this time different?.... Telecoms group BT is also having a bad morning. Shares have fallen over 5% to 241.3p, a five-year low, after some underwhelming results this morning. Profits over the last nine months are down 9%, and the company has also reported a fall in TV customers - despite splashing out on live Ashes coverage (given England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, perhaps they should have spared us....) My colleague Mark Sweney points out that BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer division seems to be slowing, while its IT services division continues to struggle.... At the risk of labouring the point..... Economics professor Nouriel Roubini says the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmother of all bubbles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is now deflating fast: European stock markets are on the back foot again this morning, with losses across the board. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is the worst performer. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being dragged down by Deutsche Bank, which has lost almost 6% after reporting a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac497m loss for 2017 (alongside that $70m fine) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Naeem Aslam of Think Markets on bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline: Bitcoin below 10K tells you only one message which is the upward momentum has died out and the odds are that we would continue to consolidate or grind lower. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx agrees that bitcoin is firmly on the back foot. The biggest story this Friday didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong to the traditional markets, however, but Bitcoin. Opening Monday at $11700 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remember at its 2017 it hit $20000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is now struggling to keep its head above $8400, following a week that dealt blow after blow to the cryptocurrency. First there was the introduction of new regulations on anonymous trading accounts in South Korea, one of Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest markets, followed by reports that Facebook would be banning cryptocurrency adverts on its site. Now comes the news that Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pre-Christmas rise is being investigated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for market manipulation, closing out a horrible few days for the previously ascendant product. Deutsche Bank has been fined $70m (\u00c2\u00a349m) by US regulators for attempting to rig a benchmark for interest-rate derivatives and other financial instruments. The bank agreed the settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after investigators found traders sought to manipulate rates from 2007 until May 2012. It is alleged the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff knew they were breaking the law, with one trader telling a broker that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot of people would actually do jail time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if practices were exposed. James McDonald, the CFTC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of enforcement, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no room in our markets for manipulation. We will continue to work hard to stamp it out, wherever we find it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank said it had co-operated with the investigation and had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undertaken significant efforts to remediate benchmark-related activities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reckons bitcoin is following a familiar pattern: Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at Centtrip, says Bitcoin has made a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153woeful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd start to the new year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The drop followed comments made by India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Minister of Finance, Arun Jaitley, that the Indian government \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoes not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We anticipate there will be more of such protectionist regulation. This is likely to put Bitcoin under more strain, causing it to drop to the $8000 a coin level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd January was a cruel month for digital currency fans, and February isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turning out much better. Bitcoin has fallen by 5% this morning to $8,521, its lowest level since late November. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost more than half its value since peaking near $20,000 in the week before Christmas. The selloff follows reports that American regulators are investigating whether last autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price surge had been caused by market manipulation. According to Bloomberg, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been investigating the Bitfinex exchange and a cryptocurrency company called Tether. Fortune Magazine has a good explanation: Specifically, regulators are curious about Bitfinex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with virtual currency Tether, which the exchange claims is pegged to the dollar. So in theory, one dollar equals one Tether. Tether has become a popular way for some investors to buy Bitcoin on exchanges. But the CFTC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probe feeds into worries that Tether may not be actually backed by the dollar, as Bitfinex has provided little proof of the relationship, critics say. That hazy relationship has fueled concerns that Bitfinex may be simply creating Tether coins out of thin air and using Tether to buy Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthereby propping up the price of the latter asset. Digital currencies have also been hit by the news that Facebook is banning all adverts for cryptocurrencies. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister added to their woes, by saying his country doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept cryptocurrencies as legal tender and pledging to fight their use for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegitimate activities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is faring, when January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll is released. Economists predict that around 180,000 new jobs were created last month, up from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing 148,000 (which might get revised today). That should leave the jobless rate at just 4.1%, which is a 17-year low, although it could possibly drop to just 4.0%. If so, expect some gleeful tweeting from President Trump...... The key issue, though, is whether wage growth picked up. It could rise to 2.6% from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.5%, which could fuel expectations of higher inflation in America. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says: The tightening labour market is yet to put much upward pressure on wage growth, but with core inflation now starting to rebound we suspect that average hourly earnings will not be far behind. Signs of inflationary pressures have already been hitting the bond market in recent days, sending prices down and yields to their highest level in several years. So we could see more action there today. Meanwhile in the UK, we get a new health check on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Construction PMI report is expected to show that growth slowed a little in January. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also got financial results from BT and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deutsche Bank (more shortly....) European stock markets are expected to open a little lower, led by Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda. 9.30am GMT: UK Construction PMI for January 1.30pm GMT: US non-farm payroll jobs report 3pm GMT: University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of US consumer sentiment",

                "body":"<p>A courier for the parcel giant DPD who was fined for attending a medical appointment to treat his diabetes collapsed and died of the disease, it has emerged. Don Lane, 53, from Christchurch in Dorset, missed appointments with specialists because he felt under pressure to cover his round and faced DPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3150 daily penalties if he did not find cover, his widow has told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>DPD delivers parcels for Marks &amp; Spencer, Amazon and John Lewis but only pays couriers per parcel delivered. It treats them as self-employed franchisees and they receive no sick or holiday pay. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s system of charging drivers if they cannot cover their round has been described as appalling by the chairman of the House of Commons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work and pensions committee, Frank Field.</p> \n<p>Lane had collapsed twice, including once into a diabetic coma while at the wheel of his DPD van during deliveries, when the company fined him in July after he went to see a specialist about eye damage caused by diabetes. He collapsed again in September and finally in late December having worked through illness during the Christmas rush. He died at the Royal Bournemouth hospital on 4 January, leaving behind a widow, Ruth, and a 22-year-old son. He had worked for DPD for 19 years.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77680f5040d69bbd9848f18d5cd8e36d061b32d2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77680f5040d69bbd9848f18d5cd8e36d061b32d2/251_49_2629_1577/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Lane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Lane, the widow of Don Lane, who was a courier with DPD at its Bournemouth depot.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Crease/BNPS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ruth Lane told the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a constant threat of a fine. They had to deliver the parcels to tight slots and the pressure to get them done was huge. He was putting the company before his own health. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to do his parcels first and make the hospital appointments, so he would cancel on the day. <br></p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He collapsed in January 2017 and they knew that because they collected his van. It was after that Don cancelled three appointments. DPD had a duty of care to make sure he got to those appointments, but they failed in it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She added that in March her husband had told her: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think I am going to die.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<p>Lane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death comes as concern mounts at the human cost of the gig economy, which accounts for 1.1 million people, many working as couriers and minicab drivers.

According to correspondence seen by the Guardian, he told his manager: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have cancelled so many appointments because I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the time to get there that the renal department have stopped treating me.

In September 2017 he collapsed into another diabetic coma.</p> \n<p>In the days before he died, he was feeling sick and vomiting blood, Ruth said, adding that he told her: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to work, but I have to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are like employees, not self-employed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.</p> \n<p>A colleague, who asked not to be named for fear that DPD would terminate his contract, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don was falling apart, but they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it easy on him.

                "bodyText":"A courier for the parcel giant DPD who was fined for attending a medical appointment to treat his diabetes collapsed and died of the disease, it has emerged. Don Lane, 53, from Christchurch in Dorset, missed appointments with specialists because he felt under pressure to cover his round and faced DPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3150 daily penalties if he did not find cover, his widow has told the Guardian. DPD delivers parcels for Marks &amp; Spencer, Amazon and John Lewis but only pays couriers per parcel delivered. It treats them as self-employed franchisees and they receive no sick or holiday pay. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s system of charging drivers if they cannot cover their round has been described as appalling by the chairman of the House of Commons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work and pensions committee, Frank Field. Lane had collapsed twice, including once into a diabetic coma while at the wheel of his DPD van during deliveries, when the company fined him in July after he went to see a specialist about eye damage caused by diabetes. He collapsed again in September and finally in late December having worked through illness during the Christmas rush. He died at the Royal Bournemouth hospital on 4 January, leaving behind a widow, Ruth, and a 22-year-old son. He had worked for DPD for 19 years. Ruth Lane told the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a constant threat of a fine. They had to deliver the parcels to tight slots and the pressure to get them done was huge. He was putting the company before his own health. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to do his parcels first and make the hospital appointments, so he would cancel on the day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He collapsed in January 2017 and they knew that because they collected his van. It was after that Don cancelled three appointments. DPD had a duty of care to make sure he got to those appointments, but they failed in it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She added that in March her husband had told her: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think I am going to die.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death comes as concern mounts at the human cost of the gig economy, which accounts for 1.1 million people, many working as couriers and minicab drivers. It is likely to increase pressure on the government to make meaningful reforms to employment law in a delayed announcement on modern working practices expected this week. Trade unions last night said the government must crack down on bogus self-employment. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The insecure work free-for-all has to end \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this will be a real test of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. Does she even have a domestic agenda any more?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DPD, one of the most successful firms operating in the gig economy, made over \u00c2\u00a3100m profit after tax in 2016. Both it and Hermes, another parcel company relying on self-employed couriers, are facing employment tribunal claims from people who believe they should be treated as employed. Field described Lane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a new low for the gig economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and called on Theresa May to urgently introduce new legislation to protect \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this small army of workers at the bottom of the pile \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 who are being badly exploited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Lane disputed the \u00c2\u00a3150 charge in July, insisting that he had told his bosses about the appointment months earlier. According to correspondence seen by the Guardian, he told his manager: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have cancelled so many appointments because I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the time to get there that the renal department have stopped treating me. I had to go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His DPD area manager replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I fail to understand why a full day off was required and as such do not see that the breach [the \u00c2\u00a3150 fine] should be rescinded.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd During the appointment, doctors found Lane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood pressure and cholesterol were high, he had anaemia and rising levels of creatine in his kidneys, a warning sign of renal failure. In September 2017 he collapsed into another diabetic coma. In the days before he died, he was feeling sick and vomiting blood, Ruth said, adding that he told her: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to work, but I have to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are like employees, not self-employed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. A colleague, who asked not to be named for fear that DPD would terminate his contract, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don was falling apart, but they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it easy on him. They push drivers till they break. I definitely think they contributed to this. They knew Don was diabetic. They should have looked after him more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DPD said in a statement that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153profoundly sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it had charged Lane, but cited \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confusion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don attended his appointment, but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear why he was then charged, when the charge hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been been applied at any other time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We got it wrong on that occasion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lane first collapsed on 27 December 2016 and Ruth texted his manager to say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he knows he has to come into work tomorrow as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get charged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

If we get to that point and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted. </p> <p>In contrast, suppose inflation picks up more assuredly, as many expect. Then, we still could easily raise rates another three or even four times in 2018 if that were necessary. And I would support such a faster pace if the data point convincingly in this direction.</p> </blockquote> <p>Evans said he expected US GDP to grow between 2.5% and 2.75% this year, with growth slowing over the next two years as the boost from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts wears off.</p> <p>As for inflation, he expects it to rise gradually over the next few years:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a hint that this may be in train today. Some inflation indicators over the past couple of months have been positive. I also am hearing a bit more commentary from manufacturers about higher commodity prices. While wage increases have been disappointingly low, the most recent data exhibit a firming trend. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently been hearing from more of my business contacts that firms are raising wages, giving additional bonuses, and boosting benefits. These are all positive signs for wage growth and clear signs of tighter labor markets.</p> <p>In my forecast, I expect inflation to rise gradually to our 2 percent target, perhaps reaching it in late 2019 or in 2020. But despite the indicators I just noted, I have not yet seen many actual increases in consumer prices. So, my forecast of reaching our target is still just a forecast. There is still a role for accommodative monetary policy to bring us back to our 2 percent inflation target.</p> </blockquote> <p>Evans voted against a rate rise in December but is a non-voting member this year, so his comments won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily hold much sway when it comes to the path of interest rates, although his reasoning is interesting.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-07T16:43:14.154Z\">at 4.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a7b256fe4b07556c9fb7646\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-07T16:13:14.869Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The rout in stocks seen in the first two days of the week seems a long way away now, as a classic rebound in sentiment sees the Dow gain over 200 points within the first two hours, while the FTSE 100 continues to claw its way higher.</p> <p>The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash on the sidelines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 theory gets a lot of stick these days, since who in their right mind would still hold cash when the market kept racing higher, but evidently equity investors (or their passive machine counterparts) have managed to scrimmage behind the sofa for some more funds in order to go bargain hunting in stock markets.

                "bodyText":"In another volatile day of trading, US markets ended the day in negative territory after a new rise in bond yields. Yields rose after a disappointing bond auction and reports of a new budget deal which would increase current spending caps. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 19.42 points at 24,893.35. After an earlier rise of 381 points this was its biggest turnaround since August 2015. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 ended down 0.5%. On that note we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close up until tomorrow. After their declines on Tuesday, European markets have taken their cue from the overnight rise on Wall Street and also the opening optimism in the US. The FTSE 100, which saw its biggest losses since the Brexit vote on Tuesday, has recovered more than half of the decline, and there was a similar picture elsewhere. Signs that Germany was putting its political differences aside also helped sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 138.02 points or 1.93% at 7279.42 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 1.6% to 12,590.43 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.82% to 5255.90 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 2.86% better at 22,986.18 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.7% at 9976.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.33% to 849.94 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 132 points or 0.49%, off its best levels after US ten year bond yields rose to a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high of 2.828% in the wake of a disappointing auction. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow (unless something major happens before then). Thanks for reading and all your comments. Meanwhile, Greece is mulling pushing ahead with the sale of a seven-year euro benchmark bond - postponed on account of the sell-off - on Thursday, bankers say. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After years of exile, the debt-stricken county is keen to prove it can tap international markets again. The seven-year issue would be its boldest market foray yet, and was formally announced on Monday with trading expected to take place Tuesday. Instead, Greek finance officials took one look at the market rout and thought better of it. But depending on how the US markets perform, trade could begin Thursday bankers are now saying. Greece hopes to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn with the issue as part of efforts to build up a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19bn cash buffer that would allow the country to cover debt repayments independently when its third international bailout programme officially expires in August. Back with cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin is up 4% to $8,050 despite negative comments from Goldman Sachs. Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at payments specialist Centtrip, said: Bitcoin staged a solid recovery today, having previously fallen 70% from its record highs last December. The cryptocurrency briefly dropped below the $6,000 a coin level before gaining almost 40%, and is now back above $8,000 a coin. The rise comes at a time when Goldman...suggested market participants should be ready for cryptocurrencies to hit zero. According to the bank, the fall in cryptocurrencies, which erased nearly $500 billion worth of market value over the last month, could get a lot worse. Nouriel Roubini, an American economist, suggested that bitcoin was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmuch worse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than Tulipmania. His comments had zero impact on the recent surge in Bitcoin, suggesting that some of the optimism around cryptocurrencies is still there. A break of $9,500 would signal further gains for the coin, but a longer term move lower is more likely. US interest rates should not rise before the middle of the year, according to Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans. With the recent strong data - notably Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth - analysts have been becoming more convinced a rate rise is on the cards in March, with four rather than three rises in the rest of the year. But speaking at a conference in Iowa, Evans said: With the data I see today, my policy strategy would be to keep policy on hold until midyear or so in order to assess the incoming inflation data. If we get to that point and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted. In contrast, suppose inflation picks up more assuredly, as many expect. Then, we still could easily raise rates another three or even four times in 2018 if that were necessary. And I would support such a faster pace if the data point convincingly in this direction. Evans said he expected US GDP to grow between 2.5% and 2.75% this year, with growth slowing over the next two years as the boost from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts wears off. As for inflation, he expects it to rise gradually over the next few years: There is a hint that this may be in train today. Some inflation indicators over the past couple of months have been positive. I also am hearing a bit more commentary from manufacturers about higher commodity prices. While wage increases have been disappointingly low, the most recent data exhibit a firming trend. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently been hearing from more of my business contacts that firms are raising wages, giving additional bonuses, and boosting benefits. These are all positive signs for wage growth and clear signs of tighter labor markets. In my forecast, I expect inflation to rise gradually to our 2 percent target, perhaps reaching it in late 2019 or in 2020. But despite the indicators I just noted, I have not yet seen many actual increases in consumer prices. So, my forecast of reaching our target is still just a forecast. There is still a role for accommodative monetary policy to bring us back to our 2 percent inflation target. Evans voted against a rate rise in December but is a non-voting member this year, so his comments won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily hold much sway when it comes to the path of interest rates, although his reasoning is interesting. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The rout in stocks seen in the first two days of the week seems a long way away now, as a classic rebound in sentiment sees the Dow gain over 200 points within the first two hours, while the FTSE 100 continues to claw its way higher. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash on the sidelines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 theory gets a lot of stick these days, since who in their right mind would still hold cash when the market kept racing higher, but evidently equity investors (or their passive machine counterparts) have managed to scrimmage behind the sofa for some more funds in order to go bargain hunting in stock markets. While we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell what will happen next, the current course of events has mirrored previous market selloffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c brief panic, steady recovery and then a return to the longer-term rally. It is, after all, a bull market. The rebound in markets continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 311 points or 1.28%, while the FTSE 100 is 2.26% better, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 1.8% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 1.89%. Oil prices have come under pressure amid a rise in US crude stocks and a jump in US production. Opec and Russia have agreed output cuts to try and support crude prices, but there were concerns that US producers would step in to fill any shortfalls as the price rose. Last week the Energy Information Administration reported that US production rose by 332,000 barrels a day to a record high of 10.25m barrels a day. Meanwhile crude inventories rose by 1.9m barrels last week. Brent fell more than 0.8% on the news to $66.18, giving up all the gains made so far this year. The news from the US offset reports that the UK Forties pipeline was shut with no clear indication of when it would re-open. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest comments on the stock market. Dominic Rushe writes: The stock market is making a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Donald Trump said on Thursday, days after a record-breaking sell-off on the US exchanges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcold days,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump wrote on Twitter in his first public comment on the sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,175 points on Monday following another sharp fall last Friday. The drop appears to have been triggered by news of stronger than expected growth in wages which fueled expectations of a sharper rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Commenting on the markets on Tuesday White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the US economy was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Since his election Trump US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and global \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stock markets have hit a series of record highs. Trump has consistently pointed to rising stock markets as proof that his economic policies are working. The full report is here: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boasting about the rise in the US stock market came shortly before the crash, and he has been notably silent about it since then. Until now that is: The bounce on Wall Street has given an extra lift to European markets. The FTSE 100 is now up 105 points or 1.5%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has risen 0.9% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.8%. As a sign we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in for another volatile day, the Dow is now up 97 points. After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rollercoaster ride in US markets which ended with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 567 points and the S&amp;P 500 breaking a four day losing streak, Wall Street is heading lower again. As politicians scramble to put together a two year Budget plan that would prevent another government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down around 111 points but the decline was quickly reduced to just 29 points. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq Composite both opened down 0.32%. Ahead of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open, Federal Reserve voting member William Dudley says he believes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the markets are functioning quite well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But he also said: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is expected to show robust growth this year and next after a better than forecast performance in 2017, according to the European Commission. In its latest forecasts the Commission said both the eurozone and the wider EU saw GDP grow by 2.4% last year, better than the 2.2% and 2.3% respectively that it predicted in November. For 2018 the Commission expects a slowdown to 2.3%, although this is higher than the 2.1% it forecast in November. It is forecasting a further decline to 2% in 2019, but again this is higher than the November estimate of 1.9%. It said: This is a result of both stronger cyclical momentum in Europe, where labour markets continue to improve and economic sentiment is particularly high, and a stronger than expected pick-up in global economic activity and trade. On inflation it expected a modest pick-up next year: Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, is expected to stay subdued as labour market slack recedes only slowly and wage pressures remain contained. Headline inflation will continue to reflect the significant influence of energy prices and is forecast to rise modestly. Inflation in the euro area reached 1.5% in 2017. It is forecast to remain at 1.5% in 2018 and to increase to 1.6% in 2019. And more positivity about the markets for 2018, this time from Goldman Sachs: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bit of context for the recent market falls: James Swanson, Chief Investment Strategist at asset manager MFS, is also in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorrection not a crash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 crew. He argues that the economics fundamentals are solid, so shares shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep plunging. Conditions don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be in place for a prolonged market downturn. Corporate balance sheets remain strong, while fourth-quarter earnings have surpassed expectations. Additionally, the credit markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t signaling that a major shift in risk appetite has taken place. High-yield bond spreads have widened, but only marginally, from historically tight levels. Recent yield increases in non-investment-grade bonds have been driven more by rising Treasury rates than by growing credit concerns. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a source of comfort for equity investors. In just over an hour, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll discover if Wall Street agrees... London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is creeping higher, helping the FTSE 100 recover from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-month low. The Footsie is now at its daily high, up 80 points or 1.1%. That shows that some confidence has returned to the City. However, it still leaves shares down 6% so far this year. Financial stocks are leading the rally, with energy stocks and utilities also in demand. City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta remains cautious, though: Whilst we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this sell off to continue for an extended period of time, given that the fundamentals remain strong and unchanged, it is difficult to call the bottom and judge whether stocks have fallen sufficiently for investors to see value once again. After days of falls, Bitcoin is staging a rally today. The digital currency has bounced back up to $8,200, having hit a near-three month low below $6,000 on Tuesday. Bitcoin has been under pressure from regulators and politicians in recent weeks, keen to crack down on the use of digital currencies for money-laundering and reckless speculation. But Nigel Brahams, partner at London law firm Collyer Bristow, argues that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t write bitcoin off: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current situation is like the dot com boom and bust in the late 1990s, when cynics who couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face up to a changing world wrote off new online businesses too readily. The weak businesses and valueless coins will fail, but the really good projects like Ethereum and Bitcoin are here to stay, much like Amazon 20 years ago.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average is being called down 1%, when trading begins in three-and-a-half hour. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less fear in the markets today, but volatility remains high, says Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades. It is curious considering the fact that for years we were fighting against low inflation or even deflation and now this correction is generated by growing expectations of inflation in the US. American stock indices lead the recovery in the last few year and now they spread the uncertainty around the world. Investors who had wagered that the markets would remain calm have been burned by this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil. For example, those who bought a security from Japanese bank Nomura, which moved inversely to market volatility, have lost almost all their money. Bloomberg explains: Nomura Holdings Inc. issued an apology after investors in a $300 million product betting on low volatility were all but wiped out during this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market turmoil. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest brokerage said Wednesday that it has received inquiries from individual investors after its decision to redeem the exchange-traded notes at a 96 percent discount. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We sincerely apologize for causing significant difficulties to investors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its Nomura Europe Finance unit said in a statement a day earlier. Nomura\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Next Notes S&amp;P500 VIX Short-Term Futures Inverse Daily Excess Return Index ETN involved a bet against stock-market gyrations by moving in the opposite direction to a gauge of volatility. Its early redemption -- the first of its kind in Japan -- was triggered after the notes lost more than 80 percent of their value amid the global equity-market selloff. The bulls still have the upper hand over the bears on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floors today. After two hours trading, the main indices are all up, as investors hold their nerve. The FTSE 100 has dipped back a little, up 35 points at 7179. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is up 0.6%, while the Italian FTSE MIB has gained 0.9%. Shares may have found some support after recent losses, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a strong recovery. Analysts at FX Pro reckon investors are using the turmoil as a cautious buying opportunity: It may still be too early to talk about a return to growth or to celebrate another fast and easy victory of the bull market. Rather, it seems more likely that panicked selling will give way to more calculated portfolio rebalancing. Reuters have a good explanation for how computerised trading, and bets on low volatility, combined to cause this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem: It was a steep spike in yields last Friday that sparked the initial rout on Wall Street, forcing sales by a host of highly leveraged funds, which ramped up volatility and drove yet more selling. Many of these were algorithmic funds crowded into similar trades - long stocks and short volatility. The selling then cascaded through their computer systems in a way almost beyond human intervention. The pivotal gauge of S&amp;P 500 volatility, the VIX , did come off almost 20 points overnight but was still relatively elevated at 29.98 percent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Short volatility funds were caught by the spike in the VIX and had to cover,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a genius until you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not and when it takes just a day or two to unwind your whole strategy then you were never a genius,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But volatility does cluster, so there is no guarantee that markets are out of the woods yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Important news out of Berlin. Angela Merkel has reportedly reached a deal with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Social Democrats to create a new grand coalition. After overnight talks, the CDU/CSU and the SPD have broken the deadlock and hammered out a deal that - in principle - would return Merkel as chancellor, according to media reports from Germany. But... the SPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members still have to approve the plan. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll vote in the next few weeks. Intriguingly, it appears that the SPD could get control of the German finance ministry, and the foreign ministry. That could have significant impact on the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy -- Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next finance minister might take a less hard-line approach on issues such as debt relief and eurobonds, compared to Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble.... NEWSFLASH: UK house prices fell in January, according to the latest survey from Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices declined by 0.6% in the three months to January, following a 0.8% fall a month earlier. That takes the annual house price inflation rate down to 2.2%, compared with 2.7% in December. Halifax also found that fewer new homes are coming onto the market: New instructions to sell continued to deteriorate at the headline level and have now fallen for 23 consecutive months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the worst sequence for almost eight years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally means European stock markets are bucking a seven-day losing streak. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the turbulence is over. Many of the factors blamed for the sell off -- such as fears of US interest rate hikes -- are still in place. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities research team explains: Investors seem to believe that the worst is over and that the sell-off was just a market tantrum that happens a couple of times a year but we tend to believe that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more to come. As discussed above, the key catalysts behind the retreat in the equities markets have to do with the new reality in bond yields, concerns about a tighter Fed policy and doubts over the effectiveness of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms. It was quite a mixed day in Asia, by the end, as the initial optimism from Wall Street faded: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up across Europe, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not.... Supermarket chain Tesco isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t joining the rally, though. Its shares are down 1%, after shopworkers launched an equal pay claim that could prove very expensive. My colleague Sarah Butler has the story: Tesco is facing a demand for up to \u00c2\u00a34bn in back pay from thousands of mainly female shopworkers in what could become the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest ever equal pay claim. A law firm has launched legal action on behalf of nearly 100 shop assistants who say they earn as much as \u00c2\u00a33 an hour less than male warehouse workers in similar roles. Up to 200,000 shopfloor staff could be affected by the claim, which could cost Tesco up to \u00c2\u00a320,000 per worker in back pay over at least six years. Tesco warehouse staff earn from about \u00c2\u00a38.50 an hour up to more than \u00c2\u00a311 an hour while store staff earn about \u00c2\u00a38 an hour in basic pay, according to the claim. The disparity could mean a full-time distribution worker earning over \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year more than store-based staff. Markets are rising across Europe, as a degree of calm returns to trading floors. The Stoxx 600 index is up 0.7% - a modest, rather than spectacular recovery. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, says: Just as markets cannot keep rising forever, they must also stop falling at some point, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still unclear whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reached a level where buyers see value again. Futures prices had indicated a much brighter start for global markets, but early gains were wiped out in Asia and Europe looks vulnerable. Volatility is back, and investors had better get used to it. Shares are rising in London at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is up 65 points, or 0.9%, to 7205, as investors join the rally that began on Wall Street late last night. Pest control firm Rentokil is leading the risers, up 4.3%, followed by packaging firm Smurfit Kappa (+3.5%). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small rebound, compared to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.6% tumble. Mike van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets says traders can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decide whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical correction, or the opening sequence for a greater unwind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An unwind from a protracted period of historically low volatility, yields, borrowing costs and investor concern, which contributed to high levels of market valuation, passive investing, financial engineering and complacency. As the last few days have shown us, things are always \u00e2\u20ac\u0153different this time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, until of course, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not. Royal Bank of Canada is concerned that the early rally in Asia fizzled out as today wore on. US equities recovered some ground in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session after the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record losses. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 1.74% having lost over 4% the day before. The resurgence in volatility saw the VIX index hit an intraday high of over 50, a level not reached since 2015, having barely exceeded 15 for much of last year. Although Asian stock markets initially opened much higher on the back of the rebound in the US, that performance has faded. For example the Nikkei having been up as much as 3.4% on the day at one point is back to almost flat. Similarly, futures on US equity indices are sliding with the Dow off around 1% at the time of writing suggesting the sustainability of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound in sentiment isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assured at this stage. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European markets are rebounding this after two days of wild swings, but investors are still nervous. European stocks are tipped to bounce by at least 1% today, recovering some of Monday and Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp losses. That following a surprise late rally on Wall Street last night that saw the Dow jump by 567 points -- its biggest gain since Donald Trump was elected US president. Over in Asia, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has crept higher over night, but there were further losses in China. City traders are calling the FTSE 100 up 60 points today. That should please shareholders, until they remember that the blue-chip index shed almost 200 points on Tuesday, hitting a 10-month low. The other main European markets are expected to recover today as well. And worryingly, the futures market is suggesting that US stocks could fall back later today. So, it could be another volatile day....

Not long after Bucher took the helm at Debenhams in October 2016, he moved 2,000 staff to the shopfloor. Debenhams has shut two stores, in Eltham, south-east London, and at Farnborough in Hampshire, and is considering eight more closures as part of Bucher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery plan. The group employs 22,000 people across the UK and Ireland and has 176 stores. The chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles, however, have not put off major shareholder Mike Ashley. His Sports Direct empire increased its investment in Debenhams this week by taking on nearly 1% more contracts for difference, a form of derivative, giving it control over a 22.08% stake.",

The strategy, which has been dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shoppertainment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, has been adopted by major retailers such as John Lewis, which staged an Alice in Wonderland-themed show in its store in Oxford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Westgate centre. Game Digital launched Belong in 2016 as part of a plan to move away from traditional retail sales and now hopes to accelerate investment, backed by Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money. Revenues from the division doubled last year to \u00c2\u00a38.7m, according to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report, with players typically spending more money than other customers. The average Game Digital customer spent \u00c2\u00a3165 in its shops last year, but the figure was \u00c2\u00a3239 among Belong gamers.",

But the wider problem is a structural shift in the way consumers spend their money. This is threatening famous retailers and forcing a rethink about how high streets will look in years to come, and what might be done with retail parks and malls when retailers shut up shop.</p> <p>It is not just about shoppers preferring to buy online \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although 20% of fashion sales, where the pressures are perhaps worst, have now moved to the internet. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a seismic shift in the way we spend our time and money. Social media, leisure, travel, eating out, eating in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c using takeaways and delivery services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and technology are all taking time and cash that would once have gone straight to shops.</p> <p>In food, increasing numbers of people now prefer to buy local and often. Fewer big weekly shops mean out-of-town superstores are under pressure and the big supermarkets are trying to lure in other retailers to take space they no longer need.</p> <p>This rapid change in shopping habits is boosting sales at the likes of Amazon, Asos and Boohoo, but forcing radical change on British towns and cities as physical retail space becomes redundant.</p> <p>The past few months have seen a stream of collapses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from fashion store East to shoe chain Shoon and bed specialists Warren Evans and Feather &amp; Black. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/08/more-than-3000-british-jobs-at-risk-as-toys-r-us-uk-is-put-up-for-sale\" title=\"\">Toys R Us</a> is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/05/house-of-fraser-seeks-cutbacks-after-a-difficult-christmas\" title=\"\">House of Fraser</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/05/debenhams-job-cuts-and-store-closures-likely-after-disappointing-sales\" title=\"\">Debenhams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/new-look-stores-at-risk-of-closure-as-struggling-retailers-sales-fall\" title=\"\">New Look</a> are all struggling, with all three considering large-scale closures of stores or space.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eaf541d63244231dcae30ef62f1a8e208ebbc054\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaf541d63244231dcae30ef62f1a8e208ebbc054/0_254_4230_2538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House of Fraser store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">House of Fraser is struggling with heavy debts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman reckons at least 20% of retail space will need to close over coming years as costs, including business rates and wages, rise while sales in physical stores continue to fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a slow burn,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retailers have done all sorts of things to paper over the cracks, but what the markets need is for retail to get smaller.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The challenge for high streets and other retail centres is highlighted by the fate of the former BHS estate. Nearly two years after the department store fell into administration, more than a third of its 160-odd stores lie empty, and about 30 have no tenants or development plans on the horizon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is grade A shopping London, Birmingham and Manchester where people will go  for big stores and lots of choice</p> <footer> <cite>Andy Lyon, retail analyst</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Town centres and smaller shopping centres are particularly vulnerable, and an empty department store is the most difficult space to fill. Few retailers now want such large spaces.</p> <p>Some former BHS outlets have been taken over by cut-price formats including Primark, Sports Direct, Wilko and Days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a new multi-brand concept set up retail entrepreneur Philip Day to put the retailers he now owns under one roof. But most former BHS shops have had to be broken up into smaller stores or turned over to new uses. One is now an art gallery; others are to be redeveloped into a bowling alley, a gym and a cinema.</p> <p>Peter Mace of estate agent Cushman &amp; Wakefield says any department store sites that come on the market in the capital will probably have to be broken up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am not aware of any requirements over 200,000 sq ft in central London,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says.</p> <p>He says fashion retailers are moving out of smaller towns and shopping centres but still looking for larger stores in prime locations. This suggests that while big retail centres still have pulling power, smaller stores are being replaced by internet sales.</p> <p>Andy Lyon of Pricewaterhouse-Coopers agrees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is grade&#xa0;A shopping in places like London, Birmingham and Manchester where people will continue to head for a special occasion, when they want big stores and lots of choice. Everything else is struggling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Given what has happened in the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/26/us-retail-stores-market-macys-sears\" title=\"\">where hundreds of department stores closed last year</a>, British landlords and retailers are preparing to adapt.

                "bodyText":"\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be a retailer now?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That was the comment from City economist Jeremy Cook when the latest set of grim retail sales data was released by the Office for National Statistics last Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The average Brit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has spent the past few years living by the mantra \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhen the going gets tough, the tough go shopping.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After a grim December, many had been hoping for a bounceback, but the figures showed that consumers were not as hardy as they once were, said Cook, and the retail sector was facing a long-term, continuing slowdown. Shoppers are being hit by declining real wages, record levels of consumer debt and the prospect of higher borrowing costs. But the wider problem is a structural shift in the way consumers spend their money. This is threatening famous retailers and forcing a rethink about how high streets will look in years to come, and what might be done with retail parks and malls when retailers shut up shop. It is not just about shoppers preferring to buy online \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although 20% of fashion sales, where the pressures are perhaps worst, have now moved to the internet. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a seismic shift in the way we spend our time and money. Social media, leisure, travel, eating out, eating in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c using takeaways and delivery services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and technology are all taking time and cash that would once have gone straight to shops. In food, increasing numbers of people now prefer to buy local and often. Fewer big weekly shops mean out-of-town superstores are under pressure and the big supermarkets are trying to lure in other retailers to take space they no longer need. This rapid change in shopping habits is boosting sales at the likes of Amazon, Asos and Boohoo, but forcing radical change on British towns and cities as physical retail space becomes redundant. The past few months have seen a stream of collapses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from fashion store East to shoe chain Shoon and bed specialists Warren Evans and Feather &amp; Black. Toys R Us is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and New Look are all struggling, with all three considering large-scale closures of stores or space. Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman reckons at least 20% of retail space will need to close over coming years as costs, including business rates and wages, rise while sales in physical stores continue to fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a slow burn,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retailers have done all sorts of things to paper over the cracks, but what the markets need is for retail to get smaller.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The challenge for high streets and other retail centres is highlighted by the fate of the former BHS estate. Nearly two years after the department store fell into administration, more than a third of its 160-odd stores lie empty, and about 30 have no tenants or development plans on the horizon. Town centres and smaller shopping centres are particularly vulnerable, and an empty department store is the most difficult space to fill. Few retailers now want such large spaces. Some former BHS outlets have been taken over by cut-price formats including Primark, Sports Direct, Wilko and Days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a new multi-brand concept set up retail entrepreneur Philip Day to put the retailers he now owns under one roof. But most former BHS shops have had to be broken up into smaller stores or turned over to new uses. One is now an art gallery; others are to be redeveloped into a bowling alley, a gym and a cinema. Peter Mace of estate agent Cushman &amp; Wakefield says any department store sites that come on the market in the capital will probably have to be broken up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am not aware of any requirements over 200,000 sq ft in central London,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. He says fashion retailers are moving out of smaller towns and shopping centres but still looking for larger stores in prime locations. This suggests that while big retail centres still have pulling power, smaller stores are being replaced by internet sales. Andy Lyon of Pricewaterhouse-Coopers agrees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is grade A shopping in places like London, Birmingham and Manchester where people will continue to head for a special occasion, when they want big stores and lots of choice. Everything else is struggling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given what has happened in the US, where hundreds of department stores closed last year, British landlords and retailers are preparing to adapt. Shopping mall owner Hammerson took back a House of Fraser site at its Highcross centre in central Leicester last year. The top floor has become an extra car park, prime retail space is being taken over by Zara and the department store\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former service yard is now a street of restaurants. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You need to understand your market, be creative and use lateral thinking,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Peter Cooper, director of UK shopping centres for Hammerson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is an easy way that might involve spending lots of money, and a hard way that involves thinking on your feet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The former BHS store on London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oxford Street offers another glimpse of the future. It has been split three ways: between crazy golf operator Swingers; a market-style dining hall set to open this autumn; and cut-price Polish chain Reserved\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first UK store outlet. With more and more shopping done online, Cooper says, malls and town centres need to provide experiences that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be enjoyed at home \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from game centres, climbing walls and crazy golf to bars, pop-up markets and street food stalls. In the UK at present, less than 20% of shopping mall space is usually leisure or dining. New retailers are emerging. On high streets among the fastest-growing are vape shops, hearing aid stores and ice-cream parlours.

In New York the Dow is currently in the red. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 108 points or 0.43%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story into the Treasury Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to release the official report into Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment of small businesses. Charles Randell has also told MPs that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s committed to avoiding another financial crisis. He says the impact of the crisis was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing short of disastrous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on many people, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go there again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Randell adds that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sound prudential and conduct regulation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can play a vital role in ensuring that financial firms stick to the rules, and protect consumers. A quick clarification: Charles Randell takes up the reins at the FCA on April 1, so I should have called him the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchair-elect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Now fixed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a potted history of the next head of the Financial Conduct Authority, from Pensions Age: Randell worked at Slaughter and May from 1980 to 2013, becoming a partner in 1989. He was a key adviser in the wake of the financial crisis, helping HM Treasury on the resolutions of Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley and the Icelandic banks, as well as advising on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investments into RBS and the merged Lloyds and HBOS. In addition, he advised the Portuguese Ministry of Finance on the recapitalisation of the Portuguese banking sector. The incoming chair of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Conduct Authority has admitted an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcerror of judgement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after investing in a tax avoidance vehicle. Charles Randell is appearing before the Treasury Committee right now, and revealed that he made a mistake by putting money into the Ingenious Film Partners 2 scheme. Ingenious Film Partners 2 was a film production partnership which proved popular with many celebrities and sports stars, such as David Beckham and Wayne Rooney. It used tax breaks designed to encourage films to be made in the UK. Those who put money into the scheme could claim tax relief against film production losses. Randell has admitted that he failed to sufficiently investigate the situation, when he was told by his financial advisor that HMRC had said the scheme was acceptable. He invested in the scheme between 2006 and 2011. He told the committee that it was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153error of judgement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd not to investigate these assurances. He adds: I take responsibility for the decision that I took. I was reassured to hear that this partnership had been discussed with senior policy officials at HMRC who had indicated that they approved of it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear to me now that far from taking any comfort from that, I should have seen it as a warning signal because the mere fact that an informal assurance was seen to be necessary should have been telling me that this was an investment for which there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a specific statutory framework. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a binding approval mechanism. And if HMRC did approve it in 2005, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been told repeatedly is the case, then it was always open to them to change their mind - which they obviously did do. Committee chair Nicky Morgan asks Randell if he could see that the Ingenious scheme would look, to the general public, like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rather clever tax wheeze\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to let people pay less tax. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes I can\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Randell replied. He added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I dispensed with the services of my financial advisor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after HMRC began taking action against the scheme. I conducted as best I could my own personal assessment of the situation. I contacted HMRC and asked them to give me the terms of settlement for me personally. In early 2015, he paid around \u00c2\u00a3114,000 plus interest to HMRC to settle the matter. Sir Tom Scholar, permanent secretary to the Treasury, has written to the Treasury committee saying that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment panel knew of Randell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement in Ingenious, and felt it should not prevent him chairing the FCA. But, as the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role includes protecting consumers from dodgy investments, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great start to Randell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure at the watchdog.... Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee has just published the official report into Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment of small businesses. MPs took the decision after forcing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog, the FCA, to hand the report into RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Restructuring Group over. It ends a long battle between the committee and the FCA, which had refused to release the report (which leaked last year). However, MPs concluded that it should be published, having heard evidence that RBS deliberately put companies into GRG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clutches and drove them to the wall. Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan says: The findings in the report are disgraceful. The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Committee has not taken the decision to publish lightly. Normally, reports prepared under section 166 are confidential, but there is overwhelming public interest in bringing transparency to what happened at GRG, given the earlier leak of the report, and in ensuring that everyone can see, and know that they are seeing, an authentic and verified copy of Promontory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original report. The report is online here. Shares in US retail titan Walmart are sliding, after the company missed Wall Street expectations. The company posted net income of $2.17bn, or 73 cents a share, for the last quarter compared with $3.76bn a year earlier. It also reported a slowdown in online sales growth, which will fuel concerns that Amazon is eating its market shares. Walmart are down over 8% in early trading. Asda, WalMart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK operation, reported that growth slowed over the crucial Christmas quarter. Like-for-like takings rose by 0.5% in October-December, down from 1.1% in the third quarter of 2017. Latvia continues to be gripped by the arrest of central bank chief Ilmars Rimsevics by anti-corruption officials last weekend. Rimsevics, who is accused of taking bribes, has told journalists he will not bow to pressure to resign. Associated Press has more details. Latvia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official on the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main policymaking council refused Tuesday to heed calls to resign following an investigation into suspected bribery and an Associated Press report on allegations of extortion and connections to money laundering. Ilmars Rimsevics, who was detained Saturday and released on bail two days later without charge, was defiant, dismissing the allegations against him as a smear campaign by commercial banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I made a decision not to step down because I am not guilty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-corruption agency has started a probe into suspected bribery. And the AP has reported that the chairman of local bank Norvik, Grigory Guselnikov, says Rimsevics had asked for bribes since 2015. Guselnikov and Norvik have filed an international request for arbitration to a body of the World Bank to resolve what the document claims is the request for bribes and abuse of power by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Senior Latvian Official.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guselnikov and Norvik CEO Oliver Bramwell have confirmed that official is Rimsevics. Rimsevics said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153my retreat would allow a man like Guselnikov to triumph.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is expected to open lower, when trading begins in 50 minutes. Tin hats on, folks. Analyst at Morgan Stanley think the recent stock market volatility was just an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcappetiser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In a new note to clients, Morgan Stanley warn that stocks will come under pressure again soon. They predict a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctricky handover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in April-June, when inflation may be rising just as economic indicators cool. This could be a bad environment for stocks, they warn: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when growth softens while inflation is still rising that returns suffer most. So the stock market falls a couple of weeks ago, which drove Wall Street into a correction, could just be an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Appetiser, not the main course\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from their report: Our cycle models suggest that DM [developed markets] remains in the late stages of a late-cycle environment. Rising equities, rising inflation, tightening policy,higher commodity prices and higher volatility are (in our view) a pretty normal pattern if that view is correct. Underneath all that sound and fury of the recent volatility spike, we think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still dealing with a playbook with a reasonable amount of precedent. Inflation, after all, often plays a role in a late-cycle volatility rise,as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tension between still-strong current conditions,and the effect of tightening (later). Meanwhile, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has spoken to the German chancellor Angela Merkel. Although tensions with Turkey are believed to have dominated discussions, last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group also got a mention. Greek finance ministry officials have also revealed that they expect the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next batch of bailout loans, the fourth tranche under the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final bailout programme, to be released by the end of March at the latest. Of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn total amount, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.3bn will be used to cover debt financing needs, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500m will go towards repaying government obligations to the private sector while the remaining \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.9bn will be put towards the cash buffer Athens is currently building to cover post-bailout needs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Headway is also being made on debt relief discussions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one source adding that by March 1st plans will have been drawn up and presented to the Euro Working Group (advising euro area finance ministers) by technical teams visiting Athens. Greece came away empty handed from last night gathering of euro zone finance ministers. The Eurogroup concluded that Athens still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit all the targets to receive its next aid tranche. But despite that, the meeting wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all bad. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Though Greece failed to win the approval of fresh loans at the meeting, Mario Ceneco, the eurogroup chief, was fulsome in his praise for the country. Athens, he said, had made huge strides in implementing requisite reforms. The two \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that had not been enforced \u00e2\u20ac\u201c electronic auctions of foreclosed properties, a testy issue that the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is believed to have clashed over with ECB president Mario Draghi at the meeting and privatization of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 old international airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outside the control of the government\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am confident they can be cleared soon,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ceneco was quoted as saying. As soon as that happened creditors would give the green light for a new tranche worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn to be disbursed. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici was also generous with the plaudits saying everything must be done over the course of the next six months to allow Greece to successfully exit its final bailout programme. Both officials said discussion was already underway to restructure Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 staggering debt load \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at almost 180 percent by far the highest in the euro zone. Dent relief is considered vital if Greece is to recover from its worst economic crisis in modern times. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Howard Archer on the slowdown in UK factory orders: The overall orders balance dipped to a 4-month low in February, although it remained appreciably above long-term norms. February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown in orders seemed primarily due to a moderation in foreign demand after a very strong January performance. Domestic demand has also come off the peak levels seen in late-2017 The outlook for manufacturing looks bright on the foreign demand side, but domestic conditions could prove challenging over the coming months On the domestic demand front, still squeezed consumer purchasing power and business caution over investment amid significant uncertainties largely focused on Brexit are a challenging combination for manufacturers. This is being reinforced by increased prices for big-ticket consumer durable goods and capital goods. Newsflash: UK factory order growth slowed this month, according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindustrial trends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey. The CBI found that 30% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal in the last quarter, and 20% said they were below normal. That gives a net balance of +10 in the three months to February, down from +14 in January; the weakest growth since October. The balance of export orders fell more sharply, from +19 to +10 in February -- a sign that overseas demand for UK goods weakened this month. Anna Leach, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of economic intelligence, says manufacturers are still doing pretty well. She fears, though, that uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU could hurt the sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This month saw another strong showing from UK manufacturers. Although order books weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as buoyant as they were last month, demand remains strong and output grew briskly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the Brexit negotiations reaching a critical juncture, many businesses are concerned about future barriers to trade and are looking for clarity over the future relationship with the EU. Remaining in a comprehensive customs union will help alleviate some of those fears and give firms the confidence to invest and grow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As this chart shows, UK manufacturers have enjoyed a boost since the EU referendum (partly thanks to the slump in the pound, which make exports more competitive). The UK stock market has dipped into the red, dragged down by three heavyweight members. Mining giant BHP Billiton is leading the fallers, down over 4%, despite posting its best six-monthly profit figures since 2014 and raising its dividend. Reuters reckons traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by rising costs at the company. InterContinental Hotels shares are also down, around 4%, in spite of beating City forecasts for its profits in 2017. The company announced plans for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca new upscale conversion brand in 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - and is ruling out handing shareholders any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153additional capital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while it focuses on a new strategy to boost growth. The third laggard is HSBC - still down over 3% after missing profit forecasts this morning. Over in Frankfurt, the German DAX has also dipped into negative territory after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ZEW confidence survey. Breaking: Economic confidence among German investors has fallen. The Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) reports that its monthly index of German economic expectations shrank by 2.6 points this month, to 17.8. Expectations for the eurozone, US, UK and Japanese economies also declined. Investors are also a little gloomier about current economic conditions in Germany -- this subindex fell by 2.9 this month to 92.3. Confidence may have been hit by the recent turbulence in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets, and the struggle to form a German coalition government. ZEW president Professor Achim Wambach says the German economy still looks strong, though: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest survey results continue to show a positive outlook for the German economy. The assessment of the current economic situation is still on a very high level and the economy is expected to improve in the coming six months. Economic growth in Germany is substantially driven by the very good development of both the global economy and private consumption. Inflation expectations for Germany and the Eurozone have also started to increase.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more expert reaction: Hello.... The pound is suddenly rallying, shaking off its early losses. The recovery has been triggered by a report in Business Insider, saying that the European Parliament is drawing up a plan to give Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privileged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd access to the single market. If so, that would calm some of the worries about a hard Brexit. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from the report: Exclusive: The European Parliament is preparing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153detailed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 60-paragraph resolution which will call for more flexibility in future relationship talks with Britain. The Parliament wants the EU to negotiate an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcassociation agreement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which could give Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privileged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd single market access and membership of EU agencies. The resolution marks a break from the position of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator. The Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans were revealed to British MPs during meetings in Brussels this week. More here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to William Hill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money-laundering fine, from deputy Labour leader Tom Watson: My colleague Randeep Ramesh points out that he highlighted this problem back in 2013: UK betting company William Hill has been hit with a \u00c2\u00a36.2m fine today, after accepting money linked to criminal activities. Gambling regulators imposed the penalty for failing to stick to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations. Angela Monaghan explains all: The Gambling Commission said that over the two years to August 2016, the company failed to spot obvious signs of problem gambling, and in doing so breached anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations. It is the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest penalty on record, after it fined the betting firm 888 \u00c2\u00a37.8m last year for failing to protect vulnerable customers. The regulator said that as a result of failings by senior management and staff at William Hill, 10 customers were able to deposit money linked to criminal offences, which resulted in financial gains for the group of around \u00c2\u00a31.2m. Tim Miller, executive director of the Gambling Commission, said there were clear warning signs of problem gambling in the spending patterns of some customers that William Hill should have picked up on. Over in the City, shares in banking giant HSBC have fallen by 4% in early trading. HSBC reported an 11% jump in adjusted pre-tax profits for the last year, to almost $21bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s below analyst expectations; not a great way for outgoing CEO Stuart Gulliver to sign off. Revenues grew 5%, as the bank benefits from the pick-up in global growth. Gulliver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement, John Flint, reckons he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a great platform to build on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Shareholders are less optimistic, knocking the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares down 31p to 729p. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: HSBC has definitely pinned its flag to the Asian mast, with over three quarters of profits now coming from the far east. The long term appeal of this approach is clear, with the Asian middle class set to balloon by a staggering 2 billion people by 2050. However this approach comes with risks attached. The strength of HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price over the last two years has a lot to do with better than expected economic performance from China. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all well and good, but this cuts both ways, and looking forward if China sneezes, HSBC is going to catch a nasty cold. In another sign of Brexit angst, City traders have been buying more insurance against the pound weakening. Bloomberg has spotted that protecting yourself against short-term sterling volatility is now more expensive than insuring against volatility for a whole year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually the other way round. This suggests investors expect some twists, turns and pitfalls as the two sides try to hammer out a Brexit transition deal. Neil Jones of Mizuho Bank explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit politics is expected to be more certain in the longer term than in the short term.... [but the] market is leaning toward expecting an OK outcome. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the pound is suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some pre-David Davis Brexit speech jitters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Davis delivers his speech, in Austria, at around 9.30am UK time. That means you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got time to read our profile of the man handling Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stickiest political challenge in generations: The pound is coming under some pressure this morning, as City traders fret about the state of the Brexit talks. Sterling has shed over half a cent against the US dollar, falling back below $1.40 to trade around $1.394. The pound had been rallying in recent weeks, driven by speculation that the Bank of England will hike borrowing costs. But investors haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken their eye off Brexit, and the risks of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit from the European Union. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the infighting within the government is hurting the pound. Whilst the BoE could look to raise interest rates as soon as Spring, this is being overshadowed by Brexit concerns or more specifically confusion from Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit cabinet and uncertainties over the post Brexit transition period. As a result, demand for the pound remains limited. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses come ahead of an eagerly-awaited speech from David Davis, secretary of state for leaving the EU. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pledge the Britain won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abandon workers rights and environmental concerns after Brexit. In a colourful twist, Davis is expected to promise that Britain won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn into a Mad Max-style dysopia. That sort of talk might not calm nerves in the City..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are expected to open cautiously today, after a weak session in Asia. The Japanese and South Korean markets have both shed around 1%, with some profit taking after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Although the volatility has calmed down, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still some anxiety out there, as David Madden of CMC Markets says: The herd mentality is always evident in the wake of a major sell-off as individuals like to feel they are part of the pack. The CBI will release a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector today, which might move the markets. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a fresh German economic confidence report. It may show that the recent stock market volatility, and the long coalition talks in Germany, have hit morale. On the corporate front, HSBC, BHP Billiton and Intercontinental Hotels are reporting results. The agenda: 10am GMT: The ZEW index of German economic confidence for February 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends survey for February 3pm GMT: The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurozone consumer confidence survey for February",

                "bodyText":"The Treasury is threatening digital companies such as Facebook and Google with a new tax, as it pushes for global agreement on a fairer system for ensuring digital businesses pay their way. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to use next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spring statement to announce the results of a consultation launched by the Treasury in November, on how to update the tax system to reflect the nature of online businesses. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, told the BBC on Thursday that digital companies should pay \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd levels of tax. He suggested that could mean a system in which tax is levied according to where those companies earn their revenues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than simply taxing profits, which are easier to shift from one jurisdiction to another. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the moment [they] are generating very significant value in the UK, typically through having a digital platform with lots of users interacting with that platform,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stride said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is driving a lot of value, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at social media platforms, online marketplaces, internet search engines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where at the moment the tax regime is not taxing those activities fairly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to move to a situation where we are taxing those activities fairly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Treasury sources said the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first preference would be to press for reforms to the international system at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which helps the government coordinate tax policies. But if progress cannot be agreed at a global level, Britain would be prepared to unilaterally enter into various changes, Stride said. Several big digital companies have been criticised in recent years for paying very little tax in the UK, in some cases by engaging in complex avoidance schemes such as shifting the ownership of intellectual property to a low-tax jurisdiction. Facebook recently announced a shakeup in the way it pays tax worldwide, amid mounting public pressure over whether footloose multinationals make a fair contribution to society. The company was criticised for paying just \u00c2\u00a35.1m in corporation tax in the UK last year, despite revenues nearly quadrupling to \u00c2\u00a3842.4m on the back of increased advertising sales. Progress on reform at the OECD has been stalled by a division between some nations that would like to see internet firms taxed more heavily and others, such as Luxembourg and Ireland, which value the inward investment they receive by levying low levels of corporation tax. Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of tax policy, said recently: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Countries are left with a bitter taste in their mouths because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no agreement on taxing profits of digitalised companies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A recent report from the Royal Society of Arts suggested taxing Amazon, Facebook and Apple more heavily could be one way of paying for a universal basic income, to be paid to all citizens.",

Economist James Knightley says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Jay Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first testimony before Congress as Fed Chair emphasises continuity from Chair Yellen with a repeat of the policy of gradual rate hikes. Ahead of his testimony there was some speculation that he could adopt a slightly more dovish stance, but the written submission doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back this up. Instead, Powell suggests the economic outlook \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remains strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while stating \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdsome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, namely fiscal policy and foreign demand.</p> <p>He also hints that inflation is likely to rise, repeating Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position that some of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shortfall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in inflation likely reflects \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also sounds fairly relaxed about the recent market volatility, saying that despite this, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153financial conditions remain accommodative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moreover, financial conditions are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weighing heavily\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the economy...</p> <p>As such, the tone of Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s written testimony suggests that the Fed position hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really changed under its new leadership with gradual hikes remaining the theme. However, his hints at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response. At the moment the Fed are projecting three rate hikes this year while financial markets are currently pricing in around 80bp of rate hikes. Given our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for 2018 and the potential for inflation to rise more quickly than many in the market anticipate (wages, dollar weakness, medical care costs, cell phone data distortions, commodity prices), we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starting with the March 21 FOMC meeting. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a956679e4b038071a9b32cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-27T14:09:01.963Z\">2.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hamrickisms/status/968487595394072576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell very consistent with what predecessor Janet Yellen might have delivered.

The problem for FOX of merely cashing in its Sky stake is not that this derails DIS-FOX (we understand that there is no exit route for DIS, or no impact on offer value, if Sky assets are sold before DIS takes charge). Instead, the issue for FOX would be that if it sold out of Sky only then to find that DIS-FOX were blocked, FOX would be left as a sub-scale collection of mainly US assets with India as the only material international exposure.</p> <p><strong>Likely DIS [Disney] response, in our view, will be to table a direct offer to Sky shareholders.</strong> DIS CEO has described Sky as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrown jewel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asset among the FOX operations he is seeking to acquire. Just as with Comcast, adding more international distribution (direct to consumer) and content production is strategic to countering Netflix, Amazon, etc. A counter-bid from DIS would avoid the regulatory complexities/delays in much the same way as the Comcast approach.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a9531c0e4b038071a9b307d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-27T10:31:40.150Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rupert Murdoch will be furious that Comcast has gatecrashed his takeover bid for Sky, according to hedge fund chief Crispin Odey.</strong></p> <p>Odey (who was once married to Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eldest child, Prudence), told Bloomberg:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is tanks on their lawn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> </blockquote> <p>Odey, I imagine, will be cock-a-hoop this morning. <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-sky-m-a-fox-odey/odey-adds-to-sky-disquiet-following-disneys-deal-with-fox-idUKKBN1EC1QZ\">He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been pushing for a higher bid for Sky, arguing that 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid was too low</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a952ddae4b08e3dd30f5874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-27T10:18:06.347Z\">10.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is climbing higher, as City traders lick their lips at the prospect of a bidding war.</strong></p> <p>After two hours of trading, Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now up 22% at \u00c2\u00a313.50, the highest since 2000 - and \u00c2\u00a31 or 8% above Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid.<br></p> <p><strong>Laith Khalaf, </strong>senior analyst at financial services group<strong> Hargreaves Lansdown</strong>, says the market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly smells the scent of some more action before this saga draws to a close\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcComcast has gazumped 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox with a better takeover offer for Sky shareholders. </p> <p>The successful conclusion of the Premiership football rights auction has moved the dial for Sky, which secured more games at a lower cost than last time around.

                "bodyText":"A late update: Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox have - finally - responded to Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer. Fox says: New York, NY, February 27, 2018 - 21st Century Fox (\u00e2\u20ac\u015321CF\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) notes the possible offer announcement made by Comcast Corporation (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) for Sky plc (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). 21CF remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky announced on 15th December 2016. We note that no firm offer has been made by Comcast at this point. A further statement will be made if appropriate. Hints from new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell that there could be four rather than three US rate rises this year have pushed up the dollar and left stock markets flagging. Despite Sky closing 20% higher at \u00c2\u00a313.31 - above the bid price from US group Comcast - the FTSE 100 ended in negative territory. European markets also ended the day marginally lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 7.13 points or 0.1% lower at 7282.45 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.29% to 12,490.73 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.01% at 5343.93 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB bucked the trend, up 0.08% at 22,724.46 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.02% at 9900.2 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.09%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Republican Claudia Tenney asks about more transparency during the blackout period around meetings. Powell says, I would have to look at what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re proposing. The blackout gives us a chance to do our thinking and come out and make an announcement, then after a day or two people can make speeches. Generally it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been seen as a good thing to step away for a period. Democrat Denny Heck asks when America will get a raise, saying 2.9% wage growth is well below historic averages. Powell says, in time wages should grow, but we really need to have more productivity. Republican Barry Loudermilk asks about what the Fed is doing on cyber security to protect its data. Powell says I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to put a high priority on it. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done a good job but we can do better. Democrat Joyce Beatty asks if the stock market is an indicator for the economy. Powell says we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage the stock market, it enters into our thinking, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the economy but it plays a factor. Democrat Ruben Kihuen asks what Fed or congress can do to combat wage inequality? Powell says our part is to try and achieve maximum employment, which we are doing. The only way for wages to go up is for productivity to go up, which needs investment. Those are things congress and the administration would be well advised to focus on. Democrat Gwen Moore asks if inflation target should be say 2.5%. Powell says we are committed with a 2% goal, equally concerned about undershoots and overshoots. Moore asks about inequality in the US and brings up the tax reforms again. What concerns does the Fed have about income inequality. Powell says there has been a stagnation of middle class median incomes. We need to have a better trained workforce. Moore asks if we will have this tremendous GDP growth after tax cuts, or will it be under 1%. Powell says the tax bill and budget agreement came after the December meeting. There will be a meaningful increment in demand over next couple of years from these things. I expect wages to increase this year. Rothfus asked why is the inflation target 2%. Powell says it gives us more room for manoeuvre, in terms of cutting interest rates if necessary. It oils the wheels of the economy and gives us more ammunition. It has become the global standard and it would not be difficult for a central bank to move from it. Back on safer ground (probably) Republican Keith Rothfus says, there are four vacancies on Fed, can it fulfill its duties under those circumstances? Powell says he would like vacancies filled, We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need all seven [Fed members] immediately but would be good to have more faces on the hall. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tricky one for Powell. Democrat David Scott says Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts help just 1%, budget cuts hit the Afro-American poor, there are changes to food stamp system. The Fed should get on our side. Trump is not on side of the American people. Powell hesitates. He says, these are very important issues, i take it to heart, but they are not issues we have authority over. Scott says he was waiting for that. He says, there is no one better suitied. When you sneeze, Wall street tumbles. I know you have a deep compassion for people. You should say, hold on Mr President, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t right. Scotts time runs out before Powell can respond again. Democrat Stephen Lynch asks about whether the Fed is concerned about the risks of exchange traded funds [in the wake of recent market volatility] Powell says, the markets were generally orderly through the volatility, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think etfs were at the heart of what went on. We are talking to other agencies, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question to be looked into. Republican Frank Lucas asks about the outlook for the economy. Powell sayd, it does feel to me the next couple of years will be quite strong, should be good years for the economy and I would think should create a good environment. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: The new Fed chairman appears to have his feet firmly under the desk. Not only has he managed to send the dollar flying higher, unseating GBPUSD and EURUSD in impressive fashion, but he has added to this by boldly stating that QE remains a tool that will firmly remain in the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s armoury. At a time when QE is coming under criticism again, his defence will be taken as a sign that the Fed has not abandoned this powerful weapon, tightening cycle or no tightening cycle. While equities wobbled as the Q&amp;A session developed, investors seem to have warmed to his tone and careful approach. This first date appears to be going well, with markets apparently content that Powell is firmly in the Bernanke/Yellen mould that they know so well, and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about to rock the boat. Democrat Michael Capuano talks about the British ruling on the gender pay gap, and says there was a call for something similar in the US but the Trump administration stopped it. He says that is horrendous and for a fair economy, you need the numbers and the information for getting towards pay equity. Is the Fed interesting in pursuing some degree of investigation of how the financial institutions it oversees pay their employees. Powell says he is not familiar with these rules, this is for Congress. We have a job and we want to stick to that. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question for the Fed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for others. Democrat Gregory Meeks asks how much of the corporate tax cuts will go to wages rather than stock buybacks or dividends? Powell says there are estimates out there but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a Fed estimate of that kind of thing. With the dollar rising and bond yields moving higher, equity markets are heading in the other direction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 78 points or 0.27%. Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about the strengthening economy etc suggest he may be thinking of more than three rate rises this year, and the foreign exchange market thinks so, with the dollar gaining ground as he speaks. US bond yields are also rising, on the expectation of further interest rate rises. Carolyn Maloney asks, what would cause you to raise rates more than three times this year? Powell says at the December meeting, the median projection was three rises. There will be another projection in three weeks at the next meeting, but since [December] we have seen an increasing strengthening of the economy, inflation is moving to target, there is growth around the globe and fiscal policy has been more accommodative. He says, We will be reviewing our projections, [for the next meeting] and I would not want to prejudge it. Maloney asks, has the outlook changed in light of the tax reforms and the budget agreement? Powell says, my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be taking into account everything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened since December. Republican Andy Barr says we have seen a wave of bonuses since tax cuts were announced, and will this increase wages? Powell says it is hard to trace through the effects of tax cuts on wages. Lower taxes should lead to higher investment, which should lead to higher productivity, which should lead to higher wages over time. Asked about risks of the unconventional monetary policy, Powell plays this down. He says the financial sector shows modest risk. There are some high asset prices, but no buildup of leverage among households. Following the testimony, the committee chair Hennsarling asks about the 2% inflation target and whether the Fed will move from it or replace the target with a range. Powell says the committee would be concerned about concerted deviation above or below the target. The market understands this. The congress meeting has begun, and a number of senators are having their say before Fed chair Jerome Powell gets to read his testimony. The Republican chair of the financial services committee Jeb Hensarling says there should be a sustainable path to a more normal policy and says the Fed should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stay in its lane.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Democrat Maxine Waters attacks the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies and says it is trying to undermine the Fed. After a few more partisan comments, Powell is up. Following its move on Sky, Comcast shares have lost around 6% in early trading. 21st Century Fox is down 1% while Disney, which is bidding for Fox, has lost 1.9%. Following Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on interest rates and the strength of the US economy, US markets are struggling for direction in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.09%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up just 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite fell by a similar amount. ING Bank however expects four rate rises this year, with the first next month. Economist James Knightley says: Jay Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first testimony before Congress as Fed Chair emphasises continuity from Chair Yellen with a repeat of the policy of gradual rate hikes. Ahead of his testimony there was some speculation that he could adopt a slightly more dovish stance, but the written submission doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back this up. Instead, Powell suggests the economic outlook \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remains strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while stating \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdsome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, namely fiscal policy and foreign demand. He also hints that inflation is likely to rise, repeating Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position that some of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shortfall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in inflation likely reflects \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also sounds fairly relaxed about the recent market volatility, saying that despite this, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153financial conditions remain accommodative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moreover, financial conditions are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weighing heavily\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the economy... As such, the tone of Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s written testimony suggests that the Fed position hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really changed under its new leadership with gradual hikes remaining the theme. However, his hints at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response. At the moment the Fed are projecting three rate hikes this year while financial markets are currently pricing in around 80bp of rate hikes. Given our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for 2018 and the potential for inflation to rise more quickly than many in the market anticipate (wages, dollar weakness, medical care costs, cell phone data distortions, commodity prices), we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starting with the March 21 FOMC meeting. Danske Bank reckons three US rate hikes are still on the cards this year: The full text of Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony is here. More detail from Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, including the expectation of further gradual interest rate rises. But he is not specific about whether that means three or four rises in the rest of the year, something which has been exercising investors: While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory. Despite the recent volatility, financial conditions remain accommodative. At the same time, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. In the Federal Open Market Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of ... our objectives. As always, the path of monetary policy will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Breaking: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest and most powerful central bank chief has declared that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook remains strong. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has told the US House Banking Committee that the Fed will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strike a balance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the risk of an overheating economy and the need to keep growth on track. Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony has been released ahead of his appearance at Congress in under 90 minutes time. Skimming it quickly, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any major shocks. Powell seem to be sticking to the same position as his predecessor, Janet Yellen; namely, that the recovery is robust, and borrowing costs should rise - in a careful fashion - to keep inflation under control. For example, Powell says: Against this backdrop of solid growth and a strong labor market, inflation has been low and stable. In fact, inflation has continued to run below the 2% that the FOMC judges to be most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate. Insisting that the economic outlook is strong, Powell adds: The robust job market should continue to support growth in household incomes and consumer spending, solid economic growth among our trading partners should lead to further gains in U.S. exports, and upbeat business sentiment and strong sales growth will likely continue to boost business investment. Moreover, fiscal policy is becoming more stimulative. In this environment, we anticipate that inflation on a 12-month basis will move up this year and stabilize around the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 percent objective over the medium term. Wages should increase at a faster pace as well. The Committee views the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but will continue to monitor inflation developments closely. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear the words \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpoor old Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 very often (not since he almost got a pie in the face in 2011, maybe). But our financial editor, Nils Pratley, has summoned up a smidgen of sympathy.... Nils writes: Poor old Rupert Murdoch. A media titan can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even break up his own empire these days without gate-crashers turning up to spoil the show. Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a322bn bid for Sky is bold, aggressive and cutely-timed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c qualities associated with Murdoch in his pomp \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and, very probably, marks the start of a shoot-out for the UK satellite broadcaster. The open question is who will to go head-to-head with Comcast. Should it be Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox, whose current \u00c2\u00a310.75-a-share cash offer for Sky has been trumped by 16% by Comcast? Or should Disney, in the process of trying to buy the bulk of Fox via a deal that includes the 39% stake in Sky, take matters in its own hands and make a direct counter-offer? Therein lies the cleverness of Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s timing. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive, has a decent chance of exploiting confusion in the opposition camps. Does Fox, given the importance of the Disney deal, have a completely free hand to raise debt and get into a bidding war for Sky? And does Disney, whatever it says about Sky being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crown jewel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, really regard the UK TV company as fundamental to its wider purchase of Fox assets in the US?. The very worst outcome for Murdoch would be to lose to Comcast in the battle for Sky and then see his Disney deal scuppered by US regulators, which is still a possibility...... More here: Shares in Comcast are down 2% in pre-market trading in New York, following its proposal to acquire Sky in an all-cash deal. Disney shares are also down, around 1%. Wall Street trading begins in 90 minutes.... Newsflash: Sky has issued a statement to the City, urging investors not to take any action following Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to pay \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share for the broadcaster. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: The Independent Committee of Sky notes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement from Comcast regarding a possible all cash offer for Sky at \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Possible Offer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The Independent Directors of Sky are mindful of their fiduciary duties and their obligations under the UK Takeover Code. Since no firm offer has been made at this point, shareholders are advised to take no action. A further announcement will be made as and when appropriate. Another hedge fund, Polygon Global Partners, has predicted a bidding war for Sky - echoing Crispin Odey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast. Polygon portfolio manager Bechara Nasr has told Reuters that Sky could eventually fetch an offer of more than \u00c2\u00a315 per share (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still hovering around \u00c2\u00a313.30). These hedgies aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impartial, of course. Odey Asset Management own 0.9% of Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares, and Polygon has also held a small stake. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not even noon yet, but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Evening Standard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic entry into the Sky takeover story: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Mark Sweney on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Comcast bid: Comcast is attempting to gatecrash Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Sky, submitting a rival offer to the UK broadcaster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders worth about \u00c2\u00a322bn. The media and telecoms company, which owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US, said its all-cash offer of \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share offered Sky shareholders a 16% premium on the offer from Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox. Fox owns 39% of Sky and submitted its bid to take full control in December 2016, but the deal has been held up by regulatory issues. Comcast has reportedly been exploring a bid for 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entertainment assets, which include Sky and the 20th Century Fox film studio, since the company agreed a $66bn (\u00c2\u00a347bn) sale to US rival Disney. The company, which has 1,300 employees in the UK in broadcasting and film and TV production including the firm behind Downton Abbey, promised that Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters would remain at Osterley in south-west London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for growth in Europe. We already have a strong presence in London through our NBC Universal international operations, and we intend to maintain Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK headquarters,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the Comcast chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Adding Sky to the Comcast family of businesses will increase our international revenues from 9% to 25% of company revenues. More here: Analysts at investment bank Jefferies have predicted that Disney could actually launch its own bid for Sky soon. That, they say, would resolve the danger that Disney complete its agreement to buy Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox -- but finds that Comcast snaffle Sky first. In a note to clients, Jefferies say that Disney is very keen to acquire Sky - so could offer shareholders a higher price than Comcast: FOX could in principle elect to accept Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer. In that event, Comcast has reserved the right to switch from a simple takeover offer (requiring 50% plus 1 share acceptance) to a Scheme of Arrangement (requiring 75% approval of all Sky shareholders, including Murdoch Family Trust as they are not setting up this Scheme). More likely is that FOX will raise its offer well above \u00c2\u00a312.50, in our view. This would give unaffiliated Sky shareholders an incentive to hold out and see if CMA approval of FOX-Sky is forthcoming. The problem for FOX of merely cashing in its Sky stake is not that this derails DIS-FOX (we understand that there is no exit route for DIS, or no impact on offer value, if Sky assets are sold before DIS takes charge). Instead, the issue for FOX would be that if it sold out of Sky only then to find that DIS-FOX were blocked, FOX would be left as a sub-scale collection of mainly US assets with India as the only material international exposure. Likely DIS [Disney] response, in our view, will be to table a direct offer to Sky shareholders. DIS CEO has described Sky as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrown jewel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asset among the FOX operations he is seeking to acquire. Just as with Comcast, adding more international distribution (direct to consumer) and content production is strategic to countering Netflix, Amazon, etc. A counter-bid from DIS would avoid the regulatory complexities/delays in much the same way as the Comcast approach. Rupert Murdoch will be furious that Comcast has gatecrashed his takeover bid for Sky, according to hedge fund chief Crispin Odey. Odey (who was once married to Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eldest child, Prudence), told Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is tanks on their lawn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Odey, I imagine, will be cock-a-hoop this morning. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been pushing for a higher bid for Sky, arguing that 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid was too low. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is climbing higher, as City traders lick their lips at the prospect of a bidding war. After two hours of trading, Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now up 22% at \u00c2\u00a313.50, the highest since 2000 - and \u00c2\u00a31 or 8% above Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, says the market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly smells the scent of some more action before this saga draws to a close\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcComcast has gazumped 21st Century Fox with a better takeover offer for Sky shareholders. The successful conclusion of the Premiership football rights auction has moved the dial for Sky, which secured more games at a lower cost than last time around. Indeed the fact that Sky shares were already trading at 30p above Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer price tells us the market was expecting an improved offer from somewhere. As it is, Comcast has thrown its hat into the ring and is now seeking to meet with the Sky directors to flesh out the deal. There may well be some reaction from 21st Century Fox. However, since the bid for Sky was launched, 21st Century Fox has agreed to sell many of its assets, including Sky, to Disney. It remains to be seen therefore what appetite Rupert Murdoch has to pursue Sky any further. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ben Martin agrees: European-based readers may not be totally au fait with Comcast, but it is undoubtedly a massive player. Valued at around $184bn (or six times more than Sky), Comcast owns the NBC TV network, the Universal Pictures film studio (owner of DreamWorks, and cable firms MSNBC and CNBC, the XFINITY telecoms service, plus several theme parks. It can trace its history back to 1963, when it began as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153single-system cable operator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Tupelo, Mississippi. It was founded by Ralph J. Roberts, the father of current chairman and CEO Brian. My colleague Mark Sweney has more info: NBC Universal division has spent more than $1bn on TV and film productions in the UK over the last three years. It owns Carnival Films, the UK production company behind Downton Abbey and The Last Kingdom; Made in Chelsea producer Monkey; and Working Title, the British film producer responsible for Four Weddings and Funeral, Baby Driver and Darkest Hour. NBC Universal also owns cable channels including Syfy and E!. Tom Watson, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, has just commented on Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid for Sky. He argues that Comcast must pledge to fund Sky News for at least 10 years (as Rupert Murdoch pledged last week). Watson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media plurality and Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high broadcasting standards are at stake in this bidding process. All bids including this new one from Comcast must be very carefully scrutinised. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comcast must demonstrate its commitment to plurality by guaranteeing a properly funded Sky News for at least a decade as a key condition of the sale.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As flagged up earlier, Comcast have already promised to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maintain Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 existing brand and culture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and its track record of excellence and impartiality. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no time-scale on that commitment, though.... In a fantastic twist, Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brian Roberts says a London taxi driver played a key role in triggering today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid: Readers are split over the merits of Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer for Sky. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction from below the line... Oh... and if Comcast could send an engineer round to Cobberthedog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patch, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be most grateful.... Neil Campling of Mirabaud Securities says it makes a lot of sense for Comcast to acquire Sky: There is the attraction of diversifying away from the U.S. because of pressures on the cable industry there. The regular annuity stream that you have from the subscription business of Sky will be of primary appeal to Comcast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strategic fit of Sky for Comcast makes sense. Comcast has grown to become the number 1 cable company in the US so the company has a strong background in Pay-TV. Also Comcast has a large international operation through content of its NBCU assets and has previously stated interest in expanding the non-US asset base. Comcast EV (enterprise value) is $247bn so this is an easily absorbed deal. He also believes that Comcast is acting now, because Sky has just retained rights to show Premier League football, and before the UK regulators give their approval to Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have hit their highest levels in almost 18 years, dating back to the end of the dot-com boom: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here are the key points from Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise $31bn offer for Sky: Possible all-cash offer of \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share, premium of 16% to the current 21 Century Fox offer Minimum acceptance condition of 50 per cent. plus one share Confident in receiving all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner Strategic opportunity to acquire a leading content and distribution business in the UK and Europe Specific intentions to maintain a strong presence in the UK for the combined business: Continued investment in creative industries in the UK Support for high broadcasting standards and news impartiality in the UK The combined business will have the resources and capabilities across content, technology and service to compete and grow in a rapidly changing market Accretive to Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free cash flow per share in year one Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says that Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed offer for Sky is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fascinating development\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on many levels. The deal would have attractions on a number of fronts, not least of which would be the removal of complexity from the current tripartite discussions between Fox, Disney and Sky. In a land where, increasingly, content is king, there would be synergies from a creative programming perspective, whilst the potential showstopper of media plurality concerns would probably not apply to the Comcast bid. Meanwhile, the combined group would have a stable of media, production and technology outlets which would position it strongly in any number of countries. Hunter also points out that Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 39% stake in Sky is an added complication: In a normal takeover situation, the potential acquirer would be extremely keen to have the support of the largest shareholder in an effort to ease the deal through. Unlikely though it seems, this could yet happen, but it is equally plausible that Fox will need to return with an improved bid, which the market was beginning to anticipate in any event. Indeed, the initial share price reaction suggests that this story has further to run, with Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price leaping above the level of the already increased Comcast offer. Whatever the outcome, Comcast has put the cat amongst the pigeons with a move which should make for compulsive viewing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction to the Comcast deal, first from journalist Robin Powell: City veteran David Buik says the ball is firmly in 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court - will Murdoch boost his own bid, or accept Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer? CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Geoff Cutmore flags up that we could get a full-blown bidding war for Sky Boom! Shares in Sky have jumped by 18% at the start of trading. They have surged to \u00c2\u00a313.10, up from \u00c2\u00a311.05 last night. That actually values Sky at more than Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new proposal (\u00c2\u00a312.50 per share), suggesting that the City believes Murdoch may have to increase his own offer (\u00c2\u00a310.75). Some quotes from Comcast are flashing up on my Reuters terminal now. Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts are saying that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong strategic benefits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in combining its assets with Sky. The company didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak to Sky until this morning, and hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had any contact with the Murdoch family since Fox announced its deal to sell assets to Disney. Roberts also says Comcast is prepared to be co-owners of Sky with either 21st Century Fox, or Disney. [That could happen, if Comcast buy the 61% of Sky which 21C Fox doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t own, and Disney completes the existing deal to buy Fox]. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are likely to surge when trading begins on the London stock market in 10 minutes. They closed at \u00c2\u00a311.05 last night - ahead of 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer (\u00c2\u00a310.75), but well short of Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer of \u00c2\u00a312.50. The news that Comcast could take control of Sky is sending shockwaves through the media sector. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Arash Massoudi agrees that it could disrupt Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid, and even scupper his grand plan to sell much of his Fox empire to Disney: City analyst Louise Cooper says the deal has been triggered by pressure from new media. She suspects Comcast will have to fight hard to get the deal over the line. Comcast says it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to run into any of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmedia plurality\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns that have dogged Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to buy Sky. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement includes a section called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supporting high broadcasting standards and news impartiality in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which states: Comcast recognises that Sky News is an invaluable part of the UK news landscape and the Company intends to maintain Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 existing brand and culture, as well as its strong track record for high-quality impartial news and adherence to broadcasting standards. While Comcast does own a substantial international operation in the UK, with more than 1,300 employees, the Company has only a minimal presence in the UK media market. Comcast therefore does not believe that this Superior Cash Proposal should create any media plurality concerns in the UK. Comcast is also pledging to use keep Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in the UK, if its takeover bid succeeds. Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for growth in Europe. We already have a strong presence in London through our NBCUniversal international operations, and we intend to maintain Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK headquarters. Adding Sky to the Comcast family of businesses will increase our international revenues from 9% to 25% of Company revenues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NEWSFLASH: Comcast, the US cable company, has launched a takeover offer for Sky, in a challenge to Rupert Murdoch. Comcast is offering to pay \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share in cash for the British broadcaster, valuing it at $31bn, or \u00c2\u00a322.1bn. This is a 16% premium to the existing takeover bid from 21st Century Fox (\u00c2\u00a310.75 per share). Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think Sky is an outstanding company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has 23m customers, leading positions in the UK, Italy and Germany, and is a consistent innovator in its use of technology to deliver its customers a great experience.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That bid has been caught up in regulatory concerns -- last month, the Competition and Markets Authority ruled that it was not in the public interest for Fox to buy the 61% of Sky it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t own, due to media plurality concerns. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an additional complication -- since bidding for Sky, Murdoch has agreed a deal to sell much of Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets to Disney. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big day. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful central banker testifies to Congress, for the first time since replacing Janet Yellen as head of the Federal Reserve. Investors around the world will be watching closely, for hints about how quickly the Fed might raise interest rates if inflation picks up. Worries about rising borrowing costs caused the markets to plunge at the start of this month; traders will be worried about a repeat. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Although yields have fallen away from their recent 4 year high, there is still a level of caution among investors over the future of the US economy and monetary policy, which is keeping the market on edge. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the most relevant event today will be new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance before Congress, in the Semi-annual Monetary Policy Report. This is his first official testimony in a highly anticipated event. However, given the backdrop of interest rate expectation sensitivity, which caused significant market disruption, Powell is unlikely to want to rock the boat. We also get new economic data from the eurozone, including the first estimate of inflation in Germany. The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer confidence figures 1pm GMT: German inflation figures 1.30pm GMT: Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to the House Banking Committee is released 3pm GMT: Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session before the House Banking Committee begins",

The retailer had been trying to drum up a buyer before the end of February when several payments were due. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The combination of rising prices and subdued demand is putting considerable pressure on retailers and particularly exposing those with underlying issues,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Berg. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Burdened by debt, Toys R Us has simply been unable to adapt to a changing retail environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

                "bodyText":"Time to wrap up, before wrapping up to face the snow outside.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a closing summary: Toys R Us and Maplin have entered administration on the same day, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk at two of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-known retailers. Administrator Moorfields said it was managing an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orderly wind-down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Toys R Us, which has about 3,000 staff, while PwC has been appointed to oversee the administration of Maplin, which employs 2,500 people. Labour called on the government to hold urgent talks with trade unions and the companies to ensure that jobs are safeguarded and address weakness in the retail sector. Moorfields said it still holds out hope of finding a last-minute buyer for all or part of Toys R Us, with its newer stores most likely to attract interest. Simon Thomas, a partner at Moorfields, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All stores remain open until further notice and stock will be subject to clearance and special promotions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re encouraging customers to redeem their gift cards and vouchers as soon as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said adding that customers should do so as soon as possible, before any store closures take effect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst this process is likely to affect many Toys R Us staff, whether some or all of the stores will close remains to be decided. We have informed employees about the process this morning and will continue to keep them updated on developments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story, which will be updated later. Good night, and good luck to those 5,500 employees. GW This piece may be useful for customers: Investors who loaned money to Toys R Us face significant losses. As Alan Higgins, the CIO of Cootts, points out, Toys R Us bonds were trading close to their face value until last summer - when the US parent sought bankruptcy protection. Over in the City of London, the FTSE 100 index of top shares has closed down 50 points or 0.7% at 7231. The selloff was mainly due to worries that American interest rates are going to rise sharply this year. But the problems at Toys R Us and Maplin did cast a shadow over traders. Consumer cyclical stocks fell 0.5%, while non-cyclicals fell almost 1%. Among smaller companies, Mothercare slumped 9% to a new all-time low of just 28.35p (back in 2010 they were worth over \u00c2\u00a35). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twin administrations show that retailers are suffering badly. Other casualties could follow, she fears. Firstly, the squeeze on the consumer thanks to elevated levels of inflation, combined with wage declines in real term, which is causing consumers to rein in their spending on damaging level. And secondly, this reining back in spending couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have come at a worst time in the high street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history, as consumer habits change towards online shopping, favouring the likes of Amazon for their fast delivery and wider selection and more competitive pricing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This brutal combination is hitting the high street hard. Stores are struggling at best, but if in the case of Toys R\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 US there is excessive additional burdens, then survival is questionable. It is very unlikely that these two retail giants will be the last casualties on the higher street, quite the opposite. With the online shopping revolution in full swing and tough economic conditions set to continue for the UK in the face of Brexit, there is a very good probability that more victims will fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Heads-up: That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen as usual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sign outside Toys R Us in Manchester isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as new as I thought, sorry.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chilly corner of intu Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley, near Birmingham, that captures today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim retail news. There, a Maplin and a Toys R Us store sit, side by side - with a sign in one of the windows confirming that the administrators are now in charge. Reader Shaukat Abbas kindly sent me these photos: Over in Manchester, my colleague Frances Perraudin has been speaking to Maplin customers about its fall into administration this morning (reminder, she visited Toys R Us earlier) She writes: Coming out of a small Maplin store on Manchester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oxford Road, student Jack Poulton was clear that the business has been a victim of the rise of e-commerce. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of the products that they sell, a lot of people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially younger generations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will now look online for,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only reason I came in today is its proximity to the university and because I needed something immediately, otherwise I would have gone online myself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Poulton had visited the shop, which has been on the same site for more than 30 years, to see if they stocked a specific magnifying lens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the manager knew instantly where to look. I would have no complaints about the service. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to find what they sell in Maplin on Amazon these days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fellow student Mike Ellis said it was a shame that the expertise held by staff at electrical shops like Maplin was being lost. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes you just want to be given advice, which these guys are very well trained for. Without that you are suddenly on your own.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Inside the tidy and well-ordered store this lunch time, the staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who usually outnumbered customers three-to-one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c said they could not speak to the press, but confirmed that they had heard the news about the business that morning. Aslam Malik, who works for Manchester city council, popped in on his way past, after hearing that the company was going into administration, to see if they had a cheap DVD player for his nephew. He did not find what he was looking for. He aded: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What they sell is quality stuff, but they are very expensive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can buy a printer for \u00c2\u00a320 or \u00c2\u00a330 from Tesco and Asda these days. I would usually look on ebay and at the big supermarkets for things like that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Update: I incorrectly wrote earlier that the Toys R Us branch in Manchester has hung an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen as usual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sign outside. A reader has now got in touch, to kindly explain that the sign has been there for a while (!). Apologies... Toy sellers have been hit by a triple-whammy of problems recently, which all contributed to Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predicament. The slump in the pound after the Brexit vote has driven up costs, while the growth of electronic devices, and the rise of counterfeit goods have eaten into sales. Amisha Chohan, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales in the UK toy market fell by 2.8% to \u00c2\u00a33.4bn in 2017, according to the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) and the NPD Group. This has been driven by a number of reasons; there has been a shift to screen games as opposed to physical toys. Licenses have been under-performing for a while, and there is the ever-growing concern of counterfeit toys. As with all retailers, toy shops have also been impacted by the shift to online sales. The impact of Brexit on the strength of the Sterling (particularly last year), together with inflationary pressures such as the increase in minimum wage, has also made a significant dent into their margins.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin into administration is going to ripple through the UK retail sector - and hurt companies in their supply chain. Helena Kanczula, Corporate Tax Director at accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg, explains that some suppliers will be left with unpaid bills. There is an order of priority regarding who ranks above who when a company goes into liquidation and trade creditors would be below secured creditors such as banks and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees. There may therefore be limited funds available to distribute to suppliers. Research from YouGov has shown that the UK public lost confidence in Toys R Us after its US parent limped into bankruptcy protection last autumn. Amelia Brophy, Head of Data Products UK at YouGov, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Certainly, in the UK at least, people recognised the struggles the brand was experiencing. Its Buzz score (whether you have something positive or negative about a brand) had lingered around the +2 mark prior to September 2017. Since that time, its score has plummeted to a low point of -25. The knock-on effect of this is that the public opinion deteriorated. Its Impression score, which had stood around the +16 mark, dropped as low as -1. Most damaging of all of course, it that fewer people felt that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d consider shopping with Toys R US. Its Purchase Consideration (would you consider buying something from a brand) score among the general public had declined to +9 prior to the news it has entered administration, where once it had averaged a more respectable +15. It would have been hoping that the Christmas trading period would have injected some life back into the business, but our data indicates that it struggled to attract customers in the same way it once had, with only a small rallying in Impression score and Buzz. This is despite its Ad Awareness score jumping to +17, which does compete with previous years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 levels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The British arm of Toys R US has been struggling since its US parent company filed for bankruptcy protection last September. The UK arm kept operating, in the hope of finding a buyer. That sounds laudable, but Philip Marshall QC of Serle Court argues that creditors could now lose out. The list of creditors includes the government (through its unpaid \u00c2\u00a315m VAT bill) and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pensions protection scheme (which picks up a \u00c2\u00a337m deficit). Marshall explains why some tough questions need to be asked: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the face of it one might say it is a surprise that the administration of the UK subsidiary of Toy R Us did not come sooner given the insolvency of its parent in the US some months ago and the well known difficulties of high street retailers in the face of online rivals. One question that may need proper investigation is whether the board acted properly in deferring administration in the face of market pressures (and ongoing losses) in the hope of securing a sale. Given that there is apparently a deficit to both the Revenue and Pension Protection Fund the outcome for trade creditors cannot be good and they may wish a proper investigation to be undertaken by the administrators to determine whether there is culpability here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Toys R Us nearly collapsed last December, before the company agreed to inject an extra \u00c2\u00a39m into its pension fund. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration means Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pension Protection Fund takes over the scheme, which currently has a \u00c2\u00a337m black hole. Ian Browne, pension specialist at Old Mutual Wealth, says existing pensioners will be protected, while current workers will lose some of their pension pot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Members of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension schemes need not panic. When schemes collapse they fall into the hands of the PPF, who have the responsibility for paying workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pensions. Those who already reached the scheme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal pension age will receive 100% of their pension. For those who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached the normal pension age, the PPF will pay 90% of what their pension is worth, up to a cap. This cap is currently just over \u00c2\u00a338,500 per year for someone retiring at 65, so it only affects the highest earners. Members of the scheme can still take early retirement and a tax-free cash lump sum. In fact, the way PPF calculates these can sometimes be more generous than a typical scheme. The problems at Toys R Us show that the era of retail parks may be over. So argues Dr Gordon Fletcher, retail expert at the University of Salford Business School. He says large out-of-town retail parks fail to meet customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With ToysRUs and Maplin going into administration today, the constant change in the retail sector is now being felt in retail parks as much as the high street. These familiar brands have struggled to keep pace with the growing preference for online retail. But it is not just a matter of more people buying online, it is also what these retailers offered as their customer experience. Visiting a toystore with children is generally a fraught experience for most adults. Combined with the fact that a planned visit to a toystore will often require a degree of secrecy from the very same children, the failure of Toys R Us becomes much clearer. With a business model that imitated a grocery superstore that relied primarily on offering competitive pricing points in out-of-town locations there were few opportunities to discover something new or to create an environment that encouraged adult drivers to linger as long as their children wanted to. Our North of England reporter Frances Perraudin reports from a Toys R Us store in Manchester: Late on Wednesday morning, removal men Mark Connor and John Banks have popped into a tired looking Toys \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Us store on the outskirts of Manchester city centre for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nostalgia trip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a relic from the 80s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last time I came here, I was playing with transformers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Connor is keeping his eye out for Lego or Star Wars toys for his five-year-old son, but despite this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that the company would be going into administration, he says prices at the shop in the Ancoats area of the city are still too high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just compared one item they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got over there to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on ebay and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a340 there and you can get it for \u00c2\u00a315 online.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think toy shops like this put smaller toy shops out of business, so I personally think [the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse] might actually give the smaller toy shops a bit of a niche market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Connor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing, because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never a good thing when a big company goes out of business because loads of people lose their jobs, but it might regenerate a local toy shop mentality and help local businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The 30,000 square foot store was earmarked for closure before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, as the area is in line for redevelopment. On Wednesday morning only a small handful of customers could be seen wandering through its aisles of garish toys, with around 15 members of staff standing huddled chatting near the tills. Mike Meszaros, who works in branding, has come into the store to find an outfit for his son for World Book Day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I remember coming in here when I was seven years old and it was busy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d come in and it was like Hamley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have staff demonstrating the toys. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have stuff set up that you could play with and there would be toys everywhere that you could use before you bought them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like that now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite sad really.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour MP Peter Kyle says Maplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration shows the wider impact of the weak pound on UK firms who import goods. Far from ushering in a bright economic future, the threat of Brexit has put jobs and investment at risk. Adam Deacock, a Barrister at Radcliffe Chambers, fears it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be possible to save all Toys R Us and Maplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores. He explains: The administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statutory task is to rescue a company and its business as a going concern if this is possible. In practical terms this is highly unlikely, as a buyer will be unlikely to wish to take over their debts and liabilities or all of their stores, so the administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 next task is to attempt to get the most they can for the assets. The hope for the companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 5,500 employees is that a buyer can be found for the businesses who will take over as many as possible of the stores, their employees and their pensions in one go, but the administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concern is simply to produce the best result for creditors. Deacock points out that the UK government could be hit in the pocket: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As taxpayers we should all be concerned as the immediate cause of Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 administration appears to be its unpaid VAT bill of \u00c2\u00a315m and other unpaid tax debts can be expected. Another interesting tweet from Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien, suggesting that Amazon will profit from Maplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems: Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien of UK Research Director at Global Data Retail reckons that Smyths, Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest toy retailer, was at least partly responsible for Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise. Smyths has been expanding in the UK recently, and almost doubled its UK pre-tax profits last year. It has offered a range of bargain toys, aimed at shoppers on a budget. Pat Lynes, business transformation expert and founder of Sullivan &amp; Stanley, fears that more retailers will follow Maplin and Toys R US. Lynes pins the blame on outdated management who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adjusted to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business conditions: Toys R Us and Maplin facing collapse is sadly not surprising. They haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t re-engineered their operating model to focus on digital platforms and the customer experience. A lot of executives of these older corporations are sitting within organisational structures that were fit for the nineties and maybe the noughties, but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid-pace, changing world. Without the ability to adapt quickly, sales will slide. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same Blockbuster story repeating - how many others will be next? Another example of why high street stores such as Maplin will be missed. Dr Coxon now works at Cambridge University, making silicon solar cells more efficient, so those projects clearly paid off. PwC have confirmed that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken control of Maplin, and are looking for a buyer for some, or all, of the company. They also say that Maplin was hurt by the fall in sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which slumped against rival currencies after the Brexit vote in June 2016. Zelf Hussain, joint administrator and PwC partner, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The challenging conditions in the UK retail sector are well documented. Like many other retailers, Maplin has been hit hard by a slowdown in consumer spending and more expensive imports as the pound has weakened. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our initial focus as administrators will be to engage with parties who may be interested in acquiring all or part of the company. We will continue to trade the business as normal whilst a buyer is sought. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Staff have been paid their February wages and will continue to be paid for future work while the company is in administration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dom Tribe, retail sector specialist at supply chain firm, Vendigital, says Toys R Us failed to keep pace with changing shopping habits, including internet retail. Despite losing significant market share to competitors such as Amazon and Argos, Toys R Us failed to implement an effective E-commerce model with expedited shipping options and also continued to rely on its large warehouses. Opened in the 1980s and 90s, these have proven highly costly to run, with difficulties around managing stock levels, and have been outperformed by its new smaller stores. Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 relationships with key suppliers also hit the headlines over the last year, with the chain demanding long payment terms and exclusivity on certain ranges despite no longer being the key player in the market. Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff has written a good thread about why the collapse of toy stores matters: City analyst Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says retailers are suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153structural game-changers and a softening in consumer confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which can be fatal for firms who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adjusted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toys R Us has officially entered administration, with stores to remain open for the time being. The company failed to adapt and was stuck with a large portfolio of large warehouse shops. No experience for customers, no compelling online presence. A \u00c2\u00a315m VAT bill did for Toys R Us in the end after another poor Christmas, but it was a systemic failure to move with the changes in the retail sector that really did for it. Maplin has also gone into administration in what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a pretty torrid day for UK retail. In both cases the Amazon effect is all too clear to see, but there is more to it than that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are retailers out there who are adapting and prospering. He also points out that Mothercare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen today (currently down 7%, having been 12% lower earlier). Maplin, like Toys R Us, has struggled in the face of online retailers who were able to undercut its prices. But if the company does disappear from the high street, shoppers may struggle to lay their hands on a particular cable, battery or peripheral at short notice: Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, is urging the government to help Maplin and Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devastating that over 5,500 High Street jobs risk being lost. This latest shock in the retail sector continues a worrying trend for our shopping streets and centres. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government must urgently meet with both the unions and the companies to ensure that these jobs are safeguarded. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Workers are suffering stress and anxiety not knowing what the future holds for them. In the event of job losses, the Government must act quickly to ensure all workers receive swift redundancy payments and are properly supported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government must also urgently address problems across the retail sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BREAKING: Electrical goods chain Maplin has also fallen into administration, in an increasingly dark morning for UK retail. This puts around 2,500 jobs at risk. Maplin, which has over 200 stores in the UK, was forced into administration after failing to find new funding -- less than an hour after Toys R US suffered the same fate. Graham Harris, CEO of Maplin, has blamed the slump in the pound since the EU referendum, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can confirm this morning that it has not been possible to secure a solvent sale of the business and as a result we now have no alternative but to enter into an administration process. During this process Maplin will continue to trade and remains open for business. The business has worked hard over recent months to mitigate a combination of impacts from sterling devaluation post Brexit, a weak consumer environment and the withdrawal of credit insurance. This necessitated an intensive search for new capital that in current market conditions has proved impossible to raise. These macro factors have been the principal challenge not the Maplin brand or its market differentiation. We believe passionately that Maplin has a place on the high street, and that our trust, credibility and expertise meets a customer need that is not supported elsewhere. We will now work tirelessly alongside Zelf Hussain, Toby Underwood and Ian Green, from PWC, who have been appointed as the as Joint Administrators of Maplin Electronics Limited, to achieve the best possible outcome for all of our colleagues and stakeholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A whopping VAT tax bill helped to push Toys R Us over the edge. The company owed \u00c2\u00a315m, and a disappointing Christmas trading performance left it without enough funds to pay - triggering its fall into administration. Time for some nostalgia with Geoffrey the Giraffe, who starred in Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s iconic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMagical Place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advert back in 1989: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Davies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breaking news story on Toys R Us: Toys R Us staff discovered earlier this morning that their employer has fallen into administration. Moorfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partner Simon Thomas, who is now running Toys R Us, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have informed employees about the process this morning and will continue to keep them updated on developments. We are grateful for the commitment and hard work of employees as the business continues to trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for Toys R Us customers and staff, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s undoubtedly distressing news for employees of Toys \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Us especially because their fates have been uncertain for so long. Unfortunately they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only retailer that has been struggling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone who is worried about the future of their job should prepare themselves now. Check what redundancy rights you have and dig out any income or mortgage protection policies you hold just in case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toys \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Us have reported they will continue trading for now, however it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently unknown whether they will still accept gift vouchers and offer refunds. If the administrators decide to suspend gift vouchers and refunds and you paid in cash you could be in for a lengthy battle to get your money back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her guide explaining how credit card spending is protected in the UK: How does Section 75 protect your credit card spending? Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, says Toys R Us is another victim of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seismic structural changes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hitting the UK high streets (such as rising operating costs and the threat from online retailers). He adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Put simply, the retailer was too slow to embrace omnichannel, were burdened with too many stores and failed to deliver a retail \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexperience\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 good enough to stand out from their competitors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administrators haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hopes of finding a buyer, for at least some of its 100+ outlets. In the meantime, existing stock will probably be offered at a sharp discount: Toys R Us customers are being urged to cash in any vouchers and gift cards ASAP, following its collapse into administration this morning. Toys R US has been dragged into administration by its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unmanageable rent bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to the Financial Times. It says: Executives had been battling to raise cash to pay a tax liability that fell due this week, but the efforts collapsed after a number of private equity funds and restructuring specialists walked away. Insolvency specialists at Moorfields have begun the process of closing its British operations, which employ nearly 3,000 people and has an estimated funding shortfall of at least \u00c2\u00a325m in its pension scheme. Retail analyst Fiona Paton points out that several other retailers have gone under recently: NEWSFLASH: Retailer Toys R Us has fallen into administration, putting around 3,000 jobs at risk. Press Association has the details: Administrator Moorfields has been appointed to conduct what it called an orderly wind-down of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s store portfolio, although the firm insisted it is still seeking a buyer. Simon Thomas, Moorfields partner, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will be conducting an orderly wind-down of the store portfolio over the coming weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All stores remain open until further notice and stock will be subject to clearance and special promotions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re encouraging customers to redeem their gift cards and vouchers as soon as possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Toys R Us retailer has been hunting for a buyer for several weeks, but without success. The company, which has 105 stores in the UK, is a subsidiary of the eponymous US company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada last year after amassing $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.7bn) of debt. More to follow.... Asia-Pacific markets have closed lower, with Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index down 2%, China off nearly 0.9% and Australia losing 0.7%. London-focused estate agent Foxtons has blamed a plunge in profits on Brexit uncertainty and stamp duty changes that have driven sales in the capital to near record lows. The company said waning consumer confidence against a backdrop of political uncertainty was weighing on the London housing market, driving a 65% fall in pre-tax profits in 2017 to \u00c2\u00a36.5m. Foxtons said changes to rules in 2016, when the government imposed a new stamp duty surcharge on second homes, had also contributed to a weaker market and falling profits. Nic Budden, the chief executive, warned 2018 would be another tough year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are pleased to have delivered a performance in line with market expectations. However, sales activity in the London property market is near historic lows and this had a significant impact on our overall performance in 2017. UK broadcaster ITV has slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after reporting a 10% drop in earnings. Statutory pre-tax profits fell to \u00c2\u00a3500m last year, from \u00c2\u00a3553m in 2016, highlighting the tough market for advertising. ITV blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertain economic environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is overshadowing new CEO Carolyn McCall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrategic refresh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It has also stopped paying a special dividend to shareholders (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still getting a normal divi, though). McCall sounds confident about the future, saying: We have a solid foundation to build on, and a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows gives ITV the flexibility to make the right strategic decisions for the long term future of ITV in an increasingly competitive environment whilst still delivering sustainable returns to shareholders. The prospect of several US interest rate rises this year has also hit American government bonds. As the price of US Treasuries has fallen, the yield (or interest rate) on the bond has risen. If borrowing costs are indeed going up, then investors want a higher return on their money. This means the gap between US and eurozone bonds has hit its widest level since the euro was created. European stock markets are all falling in early trading, as investors react to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony from Fed chair Jerome Powell. The main indices are all down around 0.5% - a modest move, but one that highlights the worries about US interest rates. In London, the FTSE 100 has been pulled down by mining stocks. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re suffering because Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat comments have boosted the US dollar (thus pushing down commodity prices, which are priced in dollars). Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undeniable optimism towards the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and his hawkish comments on interest rate moves, is hurting the markets, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Due to Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong outlook on the US economy, he considers it necessary to continue gradually increasing interest rates in order to prevent the US economy from overheating. On his hawkish tone, when asked the million-dollar question about 3 hikes or 4, Powell was quick to point out the improvements in the economy and his optimism that inflation will reach the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target, in what can only be described as a hawkish response, which to many signalled 4 hikes could be on the cards in 2018. Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments unleashed a wave of anxiety among equity traders, who rushed to sell out of holdings. Vive la France! Statistics body INSEE has just raised its forecast for French growth last year to 2%, up from 1.9%. That confirms that 2017 was the best year for France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy since 2011. INSEE also confirmed that GDP rose by 0.6% in the last three months of 2017, matching its initial estimate. With all this talk about interest rate rises, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that America doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have an inflation problem right now.... Stock markets across Asia have all fallen today, after Fed chair Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish comments reignited interest rate hike fears. The Japanese and Hong Kong indices are leading the selloff, down 1,5% each. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Cautious investors are taking a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guarded approach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM: It is becoming increasingly clear that global stocks still remain highly sensitive to the prospects of rising inflation and interest rate fears. With Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony fuelling market speculation of higher US interest rates this year, stock markets remain exposed to downside risks as equity bears lurk in the background. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders have one thing on their mind today (well two, if you include the snow gripping the capital). How many US interest rates rises are heading our way, and how will the markets cope? For this, we can thank the new head of the Federal Reserve. As we covered in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog, Fed chair Jerome Powell struck an upbeat tone about the US economy when he faced Congress yesterday. Powell told US lawmakers that he has become more optimistic about the US economic outlook since December, predicting some good years ahead with rising wages growth. If he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for Americans, but potentially bad news for investors as the Fed is more likely to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation running out of control. The big fear in the markets is that the Fed could squeeze four rate hikes into 2018, ending the era of cheap money. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: A hawkish Jay Powell indicated US interest rates set to continue to rise in his first public outing as Federal Reserve Chair, prompting many to expect four rate hikes this year rather than three. Shares fell on Wall Street last night after Powell spoke, triggering losses in Asia overnight - and likely falls in Europe today. The FTSE 100 has just opened, down 36 points at 7245. Also coming up today: There could be Brexit fireworks , as the EU publishes the first draft of the withdrawal treaty. This may bring the sticky question of the Irish border into renewed focus - Theresa May has already declared that she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign anything that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153threatens the integrity of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 There could be drama in UK retail too, with Toys R Us and Maplin both on the brink of administration. On the economic side, we get updated growth figures from the US and France, plus the first estimate of eurozone inflation .
